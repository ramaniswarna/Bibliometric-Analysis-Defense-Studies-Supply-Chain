Therefore, organizations need to develop a response capability that allows them to minimize the negative effect of such events and quickly recover from them, also known as resilience. This research performs a comparative analysis of the influence that risk, vulnerability, and adaptability have on the resilience capability of supply chains in Colombian defense sector organizations before and during the coronavirus outbreak. Based on a literature review, a survey was designed and applied online to collect data from respondents related to the activities of the Colombian Air Force supply chain. For the first wave, data was collected between December 2019 and January 2020. Data for the second wave was collected in August 2020. Results suggest that identifying and managing risks positively impact reducing vulnerability and increasing adaptability. Moreover, by decreasing exposure and improving adaptability, the organization positively influences supply chain resilience capability. The results also indicate that the pandemic positively affected risk and vulnerability awareness. The identification of vulnerabilities had a positive impact on the resilience capacity during the Corona Virus outbreak. This research provides relevant information for the Colombian government on developing public policies and mechanisms of service and support for defense sector organizations to strengthen their resilience capability. Likewise, the study offers valuable information to those organizations interested in improving their resilience capability and that of the sector in which they are involved.",,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Simon Grima,Humans; COVID-19; Pandemics; Colombia; Disease Outbreaks; Government,44993,2023,44993,,18,3,e0282793,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cabrera, Benjamin; Santa, Ricardo; Tegethoff, Thomas; Morante, Diego; Ferrer, Mario","Cabrera, Benjamin (Universidad Icesi, Cali, Colombia); Santa, Ricardo (Colegio de Estudios Superiores de Administraci??n-CESA, Bogot?≠, Colombia); Tegethoff, Thomas (Colegio de Estudios Superiores de Administraci??n-CESA, Bogot?≠, Colombia); Morante, Diego (Escuela Militar de Aviaci??n É??Marco Fidel Su?≠rezÉ?ù, Cali, Colombia); Ferrer, Mario (Alfaisal University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia)","Tegethoff, Thomas (Colegio de Estudios Superiores de Administraci??n)","Cabrera, Benjamin (Icesi University); Santa, Ricardo (Colegio de Estudios Superiores de Administraci??n); Tegethoff, Thomas (Colegio de Estudios Superiores de Administraci??n); Morante, Diego (Escuela Militar de Aviaci??n É??Marco Fidel Su?≠rezÉ?ù, Cali, Colombia); Ferrer, Mario (Alfaisal University)",1,1,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0282793&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156003696,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems",

This new paradigm enables firms to deliver high-reliability products while lowering the ownership cost. Hence, holistic optimization models must be proposed for jointly allocating reliability, maintenance, and spare parts inventory across the entire value chain. In the existing literature, these decisions are often made fragmentally, thus resulting in local optimality. This study reviews the extant works pertaining to reliability-redundancy allocation, preventative maintenance, and spare parts logistics models. We discuss the challenges and opportunities of consolidating these decisions under an integrated reliability-maintenance-inventory framework for attaining superior system availability. Specific interest is focused on the new product introduction phase in which firms face a variety of uncertainties, including installed base, usage, reliability, and trade policy. The goal is to call for tackling the integrated reliability-maintenance-inventory allocation model under a nonstationary operating condition. Finally, we place the integrated allocation model in the semiconductor equipment industry and show how the firm deploys reliability initiatives and after-sale support logistics to ensure the fleet uptime for its global customers.",,,Frontiers of Engineering Management,,,,44992,2023,44992,2023-09,10,3,391-405,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Jin, Tongdan","Jin, Tongdan (Ingram School of Engineering, Texas State University, 78666, San Marcos, TX, USA)","Jin, Tongdan (Texas State University)","Jin, Tongdan (Texas State University)",1,1,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42524-022-0206-4.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156002678,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 40 Engineering; 4014 Manufacturing Engineering","9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

Additive manufacturing (AM) is an emerging technology that serves as a local supply source and can mitigate some of these bottlenecks. For example, it was possible to source medical spare parts and protective equipment via AM, even when the globally arranged traditional (formative or subtractive manufacturing) supply sources failed. To that end, this research examines how supply risks change when sourced via an AM supply source rather than through supply sources that use traditional manufacturing (TM). This study assesses supply risk using a Delphi study from July to October 2020. The findings were further explored using discriminant analysis. A mix of TM supply sources with AM (É??hedgingÉ??) can minimise the overall supply risks. The discussion conceptualises a portfolio model to determine whether to source demands via TM, AM, or by hedging. The implications of hedged manufacturing are linked to the modern portfolio theory.",This research paper is funded by dtec.bw É??

Nevertheless, scholars generally agree that more empirical studies will need to be conducted on how digitalization can facilitate supply chain resilience at various stages and enhance supply chain performance in a highly uncertain environment. To echo the call, this study develops a theoretical influence mechanism of ""supply chain digitalization É?? supply chain resilience É?? supply chain performance"" based on dynamic capability theory. The proposed relationships are validated using survey data collected from 210 Chinese manufacturing companies. The results help identify the paths digitalization and supply chain resilience can take to improve supply chain performance in a turbulent environment. The different roles of three supply chain resilience capabilities, namely absorptive capability (before the disruption), response capability (during the disruption), and recovery capability (after the disruption), which impact on supply chain performance differently, are highlighted. In addition, it is found that digitalization can bring a differential impact on these three supply chain resilience capabilities through different aspects of resource and structural adjustment measures. The findings also confirm the mediating role of absorptive capability, response capability, and recovery capability between digitalization and supply chain performance. During crisis, supply chain digitalization can increase cost-effectiveness, enhance information and communication efficiency, and promote supply chain resilience to achieve better performance. For theoretical contribution, this study enriches the research on supply chain digitalization and resilience by underpinning the relationships between the two with dynamic capability theory. For practical contribution, the research findings provide insights for enterprises to leverage digitalization to strengthen resilience in supply chain.",Declarations of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

The pandemic had an unprecedented impact on the ventilator market. It disrupted already limited supply and triggered a demand surge. We find multiple paths to supply resilience contingent on redundant capacity and local sourcing options at the pandemic's onset. Low redundancy combined with limited local sourcing options is associated with more diverse strategies and flexibility. The most notable strategy is spurring supplier innovation by fostering collaboration among actors in disparate industries. High redundancy combined with multiple local sourcing options is associated with more focused strategies and agility.

In this study, an index system was constructed to evaluate the maturity level of the industrial Internet in the building materials industry.
Method: Based on factor analysis and the entropy weight method, we constructed a method of evaluating the maturity level of industrial Internet for building materials companies. Specifically, an industrial Internet maturity evaluation index system for building materials companies was established through factor analysis, and the weights of various evaluation indexes were assigned using the entropy method. In our study, 59 representative building materials companies were selected as research samples, and empirical research was conducted. Thereafter, one company was selected to verify the evaluation model. Finally, the comprehensive scores and rankings of the 59 building materials companies and their individual scores were calculated.
Results: This study identified seven key indicators for assessing industrial Internet maturity in the building materials industry: data analysis and usage, information network facilities, intelligence level of the system, smart device networking, comprehensive integration, safety management digitization rate, and R & D digitization rate. The study indicated that the majority of large-scale building materials companies were at a 2-star level of industrial Internet maturity, indicating an overall primary stage. The study revealed that information network infrastructure had a relatively high level, but comprehensive integration and data analysis capacity were comparatively weak. Moreover, the R&D digitalization rate and the safety management digitalization rate showed consistent development levels.
Research implication: This study introduces the first maturity model for the industrial internet in the building materials industry, guiding government decision-making and providing self-assessment direction for companies.

Our main findings are: (1) The potential costs of bifurcation and consequent value-chain decoupling are prohibitive to both China and the U.S. Resistance is likely to grow by U.S.É?? own MNEs and allies; (2) Washington decision-makers overstate the threats that É??ChinaÉ??s riseÉ?? poses to the survival of the liberal world order; and (3) ChinaÉ??s techno-nationalistic threats are likely to dissipate after a period of escalation, as a result of its own resource constraints, increasing costs of key programs, and inability to sustain in the long run its rapid innovation processes due to growing central controls.

Role of supply chain management and CO2 emissions in BRICS,"Large risks and opportunities arise for production operations as a result of international governmental initiatives to limit carbon emissions. In instance, high-emitting manufacturing processes may be a reflection of productive inefficiencies and the uncertainty of the prices of carbon dioxide emissions. Recently, there has been a lot of attention paid to the topic of ecologically responsible supply chain management. Therefore, participants in the supply chain have worked together to create effective contracts, often known as green supply chain management contracts. In order to demonstrate the key role of financial efficiency, environmental sustainability, and supply chain management in sustainable growth and digital technology development, this study considers the data for BRICS economies over the period of 2008É??2022. However, under the supply chain management, this study considers the innovation efficiency, input, and output to evaluate the external determinants. However, this study employs the OLS, 2SLS, and AMG estimator to demonstrate the robust and reliable outcomes for selected economies. In compile words, this study divides empirical scheme into two different explained variables such as sustainable growth and development of digital technologies. However, to show empirical scheme very catchy, the present study uses the simultaneous equation models. Therefore, all selected indicators of sustainable growth contribute to economic growth efficiently except the foreign direct investment. Besides for the digital technology development, all factors significantly contribute to digital technologies except the carbon emissions and foreign direct investment. Additional robust tests confirm the consistency and stability of the findings reached in this research. Thus, to improve economic performance, digital economy development, and sustainability, authorities in BRICS areas should develop strategies that enhance digital economy development under the green supply chain management.",The research is supported by the following: 1) National Social Science Foundation of China: study on interregional interest compensation and regional coordinated development mechanism (21BJL005). 2) Capital high-end think Tank research project: study on the realization path and mechanism of É??lucid water and lush mountains are gold and silver mountainsÉ?ù in ecological conservation area (GDZK20190107002). 3) Capital University of Economics and Business of Beijing Municipal Universities Basic Scientific Research Funds major cultivation special project: promote green development by MSW classification (ZD202102).,,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,Humans; Economic Development; Carbon Dioxide; Industrial Development; Investments; Efficiency,45247,2023,45247,2023-12,30,58,122726-122739,Closed,Article,"Ge, Wenjing; Zhang, Guixiang","Ge, Wenjing (School of Urban Economics and Public Administration, Capital University of Economics and Business, 100070, Beijing, China); Zhang, Guixiang (School of Urban Economics and Public Administration, Capital University of Economics and Business, 100070, Beijing, China; Beijing Key Laboratory of Megaregions Sustainable Development Simulation, 100070, Beijing, China)","Zhang, Guixiang (Capital University of Economics and Business; Beijing Key Laboratory of Megaregions Sustainable Development Simulation, 100070, Beijing, China)","Ge, Wenjing (Capital University of Economics and Business); Zhang, Guixiang (Capital University of Economics and Business; Beijing Key Laboratory of Megaregions Sustainable Development Simulation, 100070, Beijing, China)",0,0,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1166090953,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 38 Economics",12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

As prescriptive analytics has transitioned from its inception to an emerging topic, there is a need to review existing literature in order to ascertain development in this area. There are a very few reviews in the related field but not specifically on the applications of prescriptive analytics in sustainable operations research using content analysis. To address this gap, we performed a review of 147 articles published in peer-reviewed academic journals from 2010 to August 2021. Using content analysis, we have identified the five emerging research themes. Through this study, we aim to contribute to the literature on prescriptive analytics by identifying and proposing emerging research themes and future research directions.

And the collaborative innovation of military-civilian S&T is an inevitable choice to achieve this goal. Due to the dynamic, complex, and stochastic characteristics of military-civilian S&T collaborative innovation, the level of S&T innovation is highly volatile. This paper takes the internal and external stochastic disturbance factors of military-civilian S&T collaborative innovation as the perspective, studies the strategy selection problem of military-civilian S&T collaborative innovation under military domination, constructs a differential game model to explore the innovation strategies under the non-cooperative model without military subsidies, the non-cooperative model with military subsidies, and the collaborative model. Finally, we use numerical experiments to verify the validity of the conclusions. The study shows that: (1) Within a reasonable range of values of the benefit distribution coefficient, the system can achieve the Pareto optimum, and the collaborative model is conducive to improving the S&T innovation level and the optimum benefit level of the system. (2) Military subsidies can increase the benefits of the system and the parties involved to achieve Pareto improvement. (3) The level of S&T innovation under the collaborative model has dynamic evolutionary characteristics of maximum expectation and variance. As the intensity of disturbance increases, the stability of the system may be destroyed.

DESIGN: This study uses structural equation modeling to test the hypothesized relationships for small to medium enterprises (SMEs) and large organizations using a custom survey based on a review of the literature and completed by 404 firms in the Valle del Cauca agro-industrial region in Colombia.
FINDINGS: Human capital strategies are essential for the effective deployment of operational agility, quality, and cost management strategies, which impact firm performance through effective outsourcing strategies. These relationships, however, do not hold the same across firms of different sizes. Specifically, outsourcing practices are lacking amongst SMEs in the studied region. The study is limited to a specific region, with infrastructure and connectivity limitations that hinder or undermine otherwise potentially valuable third-party logistics strategies.

The lockdowns that took place in 2020, especially, have had a major impact on cities, transforming urban lifestyles, economic activities and mobility. Logistics became a priority activity. Faced with changed levels and types of consumption, freight and logistics operators in cities had to adapt, while logistics real estate developers had to face challenges related to building sites closed and regulatory and licensing processes delayed. Our main research in this paper is to characterize the way the urban freight and logistics system coped with the new situation. We focused on French cities, with Paris and the Paris metropolitan area as the main case. We implemented three surveys during and after the first lockdown in France (March-May 2020), with the views of identifying challenges while characterizing stakeholders' response to the challenges. The three surveys took different and complementary forms, covering various categories of stakeholders: freight carriers (from small to large); third party logistics providers; on-demand delivery platforms; policy-makers; and logistics real-estate developers. We found out that operators adapted quickly and overall successfully, one major difference being between delivery operators and property developers. The first group experienced higher levels of financial and economic challenges; the second group experienced difficult relationships with administrations and regulations, while enjoying a rather high level of activity. The ability of local governments to deal with urban logistics challenges during the lockdowns was diverse and took several unexpected forms.","Research was made thanks to the financial support of the Logistics City chair sponsors, as well as the CNAM working group É??Convergence urbaineÉ?ù.

Then, the products are produced and delivered to the consumer through the product supply chain. We argue that product markets trace their birth to product innovations. These markets tend to start as noncompetitive, which rewards innovators. Credit access and risk determine the reliance on contracting and product diffusion over space and time. The innovation and product supply chains are encouraged and facilitated by public policies, such as support for research and education, intellectual property rights protection, low barriers to trade, science-based regulation, and well-functioning capital markets.

Publications from the leading journals on these topics were selected. The bibliographical search resulted in 1484 articles, followed by multiple layers of filtering. Finally, the most pertinent articles were selected for review, and a total of 42 articles were analyzed. Findings: The findings of the study showed that the majority of the articles emphasized the digitalization of supply chain management, acknowledging the fundamentals, applications, and prospects, revealing the drivers and challenges of Industry 4.0 technologies to manage disruptions. Most of the authors identified IoT, big data, cloud computing, additive manufacturing, and blockchain to maintain the supply chain resilience. Originality/value: Existing literature on epidemics lacks the basics and practices of utilizing Industry 4.0 technologies in the supply chain recovery process. To fill this research gap, the study summarizes the potential of Industry 4.0 technologies to lessen supply chain disruptions caused by COVID-19. The study findings are valuable for policymakers and practitioners and contribute to supply chain management studies.",The authors would like to acknowledge Multimedia University for supporting the research.,"This research is funded by Multimedia University, and the findings are part of the FRGS grant (FRGS/1/2018/SS01/MMU/02/6) awarded by the Ministry of Higher Education, Malaysia.",F1000Research,,,COVID-19; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Pandemics; Technology,44592,2022,44592,,10,,1008,All OA; Gold,Article,"Reza, Mohammad Nurul Hassan; Jayashree, Sreenivasan; Malarvizhi, Chinnasamy Agamudai Nambi; Rauf, Abdur; Jayaraman, Kalaivani; Shareef, Syed Hussain","Reza, Mohammad Nurul Hassan (Faculty of Management, Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, Selangor, 63100, Malaysia); Jayashree, Sreenivasan (Faculty of Management, Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, Selangor, 63100, Malaysia); Malarvizhi, Chinnasamy Agamudai Nambi (Faculty of Management, Multimedia University, Cyberjaya, Selangor, 63100, Malaysia); Rauf, Abdur (Faculty of Educational Study, University Putra Malaysia, Serdang, Malaysia, 43400, Malaysia); Jayaraman, Kalaivani (Faculty of Accountancy and Business, Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman, Bandar Sungai Long, Selangor, 43000, Malaysia); Shareef, Syed Hussain (NTT DATA Business Solutions, Cyberjaya, Selangor, 63000, Malaysia)","Jayashree, Sreenivasan (Multimedia University)","Reza, Mohammad Nurul Hassan (Multimedia University); Jayashree, Sreenivasan (Multimedia University); Malarvizhi, Chinnasamy Agamudai Nambi (Multimedia University); Rauf, Abdur (Universiti Putra Malaysia); Jayaraman, Kalaivani (Universiti Tunku Abdul Rahman); Shareef, Syed Hussain (NTT DATA Business Solutions, Cyberjaya, Selangor, 63000, Malaysia)",5,5,0.23,4.45,https://f1000research.com/articles/10-1008/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145134425,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems","12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

This paper bridges the gap between the international trade and management literature by examining the impact of COVID-19 on Commonwealth countries, an area that has received scant attention in academic literature. Using the Eora database, we simulate scenarios to examine Commonwealth countries' participation in GVCs post-COVID. We draw on the transaction cost economics (TCE) theory to develop a framework that investigates whether growing protectionism, associated with reshoring, decoupling and nearshoring, could potentially affect the constellation and participation of Commonwealth countries in GVCs post-COVID. Results show that trade protectionism is likely to impact the supply chains and lead to GVC reconfiguration, which could offer opportunities for the Commonwealth countries and firms to potentially gain following the geographical redistribution of suppliers.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,Funding,Journal of Business Research,,,,44791,2022,44791,2022-12,153,,75-86,All OA; Green,Article,"Khorana, Sangeeta; Escaith, Hubert; Ali, Salamat; Kumari, Sushma; Do, Quynh","Khorana, Sangeeta (Bournemouth University Business School, Bournemouth University, UK.); Escaith, Hubert (Former Director of Division at UN Economic Commission for Latin America and former WTO Chief Statistician, Switzerland.); Ali, Salamat (Trade Economist, Commonwealth Secretariat, London, UK.); Kumari, Sushma (University of Hull, UK.); Do, Quynh (Lancaster University Management School, Lancaster University, UK.)","Khorana, Sangeeta (Bournemouth University)","Khorana, Sangeeta (Bournemouth University); Escaith, Hubert (Former Director of Division at UN Economic Commission for Latin America and former WTO Chief Statistician, Switzerland.; Former Director of Division at UN Economic Commission for Latin America and former WTO Chief Statistician, Switzerland.); Ali, Salamat (Commonwealth Secretariat); Kumari, Sushma (University of Hull); Do, Quynh (Lancaster University)",14,14,,14.71,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9386393,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150294644,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

This paper examines the relationship of information risks with supply chain disruptions and proposes blockchain applications and strategies to mitigate and manage them. We critically review the literature of SCRM and SCRES and find that information flows and risks are relatively attracting less attention. We contribute by suggesting that information integrates other flows, processes and operations, and it is an overarching theme that is essential in every part of the supply chain. Based on related studies we create a theoretical framework that incorporates fake news, misinformation and disinformation. To our knowledge, this is a first attempt to combine types of misleading information and SCRM/SCRES. We find that fake news, misinformation and disinformation can be amplified and cause larger supply chain disruptions, especially when they are exogenous and intentional. Finally, we present both theoretical and practical applications of blockchain technology to supply chain and find support that blockchain can actually advance risk management and resilience of supply chains.

Blockchain technology has rapidly grown in the last decade and supply chain management has started to emerge as one of its possible fields of application. Blockchain is estimated to have a transformative impact and potentially transform and disrupt supply chains. However, despite recognizing its enormous opportunity, there is still an incomplete, dispersed, and fragmented knowledge of blockchain applications beyond cryptocurrencies. Very few business people still deeply understand how blockchain works and how it can concretely benefit supply chains. This paper contributes to closing this gap, providing a holistic approach to analyzing blockchain technology's applications and benefits in supply chain management. This study aims to support academics and practitioners in adopting a holistic perspective and realizing the potential this technology can offer in different areas of the supply chain, its managerial impact, challenges, and limitations. A ""closed-loop"" value chain perspective is adopted to analyze the benefits at each core process of the supply chain, from sourcing to final customer and reverse logistics. This paper conducts qualitative research using case studies analysis based on secondary data. Further, it builds a theoretical framework for blockchain-enhanced supply chain performance based on the results of the qualitative research. Finally, the paper discusses the major drawbacks and barriers to blockchain implementation, which help managers evaluate its real net benefits.",,,Operations Management Research,,,,44924,2022,44924,2023-06,16,2,620-641,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Difrancesco, Rita Maria; Meena, Purushottam; Kumar, Gopal","Difrancesco, Rita Maria (Eada Business School Barcelona, Carrer d??Arag?? 204, 08011, Barcelona, Spain); Meena, Purushottam (Department of Supply Chain and Information Management, School of Business, College of Charleston, 29424, Charleston, SC, USA); Kumar, Gopal (Operations Management, Indian Institute of Management Raipur, 493 661, Raipur, India)","Difrancesco, Rita Maria (EADA Business School)","Difrancesco, Rita Maria (EADA Business School); Meena, Purushottam (College of Charleston); Kumar, Gopal (Indian Institute of Management Raipur)",17,17,,13.49,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12063-022-00343-y.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154053246,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",12 Responsible Consumption and Production

Thus, we analyse the impact of factors affecting the adoption of delivery drones by logistics service providers for humanitarian operations. A conceptual model of potential barriers to adoption and development is created using the Technology Acceptance Model theory involving security, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and attitude as factors that affect the intention to use. We validate the model using empirical data collected from 103 respondents by the 10 leading logistics firms located in China between May and August 2016. through a survey to examine factors currently affecting the intention/non-intention to adopt delivery drones. The results show that ease of use and addressing key security considerations about the drone, the delivery package and the recipient are crucial for adopting the technology as a specialized delivery option for logistics service providers.

The COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, has exposed the fragility of global supply chains in many sectors. Given these concerns, supply chain networks, including those designed based on the principles of lean philosophies, are increasingly being re-examined as firms grapple with the challenge of strengthening the capacity to withstand, absorb, and rebound from unexpected shocks. Addressing the urgency of this imperative, this study presents a novel framework-based on theories and concepts in the systems engineering (SE) and supply chain resilience domains to enhance the resilience implementation capabilities that are lacking in many of today's firms.

The first is the oligopolistic market structure of container shipping, the downsides of which became evident during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second challenge is climate change, both the need to reduce emissions to zero by 2050 and to adapt to effects that are already locked in. The paper reviews the academic and policy literature and unveils a link between these market and environmental challenges which result from a focus on efficiency without considering negative effects such as diseconomies of scale and induced traffic, leading to a continued rise in total industry carbon emissions. The review likewise identifies links in how policy-makers react to the two challenges. Regulators could remove anti-trust exemptions from carriers, and policy-makers are being pushed to provide strict decarbonisation targets with a coherent timeline for ending the use of fossil fuels. Recent thinking on ecological economics, degrowth and steady-state economics is introduced as the paradigm shift that could link these two policy evolutions.",The authors would like to thank the three anonymous reviewers as well as journal Editor-in-Chief Prof. Hercules Haralambides for providing thorough reviews and detailed comments and suggestions which greatly improved the manuscript.,,Maritime Economics & Logistics,,,,44634,2022,44634,2022-12,24,4,699-722,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Monios, Jason; Wilmsmeier, Gordon","Monios, Jason (Kedge Business School, Marseille, France); Wilmsmeier, Gordon (Facultad de Administraci??n, Universidad de los Andes, Bogot?≠, Colombia; K?¨hne Logistics University (KLU), Hamburg, Germany; Hochschule Bremen, Bremen, Germany)","Monios, Jason (Kedge Business School)","Monios, Jason (Kedge Business School); Wilmsmeier, Gordon (Universidad de Los Andes; K?¨hne Logistics University; Hochschule Bremen)",12,12,,9.88,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057/s41278-022-00226-w.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146246603,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 44 Human Society; 4406 Human Geography",13 Climate Action

This often led the stakeholders and decision-makers to depart from traditional thinking and the business-as-usual processes and to come up with innovative approaches to tackle various mission-critical situations within a short time frame. In this paper, a real-life case study of COVID-19 operation management following a multi-disciplinary, multi-stakeholder novel integrated approach in aged care facilities in Victoria, Australia, is presented which yielded significant and positive outcomes. The purpose of the intervention was to develop an integrated system performance approach through the application of various quality management tools and techniques to achieve organizational excellence at the aged care centers. The case involved the use of mathematical models along with statistical tools and techniques to address the specific problem scenario. A system-wide management plan was proposed, involving various agencies across several residential aged care facilities during the pandemic. A three-step methodological framework was developed, where Six Sigma, a system thinking approach, and a holistic metric were proposed to manage the value chain of the pandemic management system. The experimental result analyses showed significant improvement in the management process, suggesting the validity and potential of this holistic approach to stabilize the situation and subsequently set the conditions for operations excellence within the sectors. The model offers new insight into the existing body of knowledge and offers an efficient approach to achieving operational excellence in any organization or business regardless of its type, shape and complexity, which can help practitioners in managing complex, mission-critical situations like a pandemic.",,Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions.,Operations Management Research,,,,44841,2022,44841,2023-03,16,1,531-553,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Jadhav, Sandeep; Imran, Ahmed; Haque, Marjia","Jadhav, Sandeep (Department of Defence, Government of Australia, Melbourne, Australia); Imran, Ahmed (Information, Technology (IT) & Systems, University of Canberra, Canberra, Australia); Haque, Marjia (Information, Technology (IT) & Systems, University of Canberra, Canberra, Australia)","Haque, Marjia (University of Canberra)","Jadhav, Sandeep (Department of Defence); Imran, Ahmed (University of Canberra); Haque, Marjia (University of Canberra)",1,1,,1.05,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12063-022-00323-2.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151669170,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

Existing regulatory systems have proven to be inadequate for assessing and managing the tens of thousands of chemicals in commerce. A different approach is urgently needed to minimize ongoing production, use, and exposures to hazardous chemicals. The premise of the essential-use approach is that chemicals of concern should be used only in cases in which their function in specific products is necessary for health, safety, or the functioning of society and when feasible alternatives are unavailable. To optimize the essential-use approach for broader implementation in the United States and Canada, we recommend that governments and businesses (1) identify chemicals of concern for essentiality assessments based on a broad range of hazard traits, going beyond toxicity; (2) expedite decision-making by avoiding unnecessary assessments and strategically asking up to three questions to determine whether the use of the chemical in the product is essential; (3) apply the essential-use approach as early as possible in the process of developing and assessing chemicals; and (4) engage diverse experts in identifying chemical uses and functions, assessing alternatives, and making essentiality determinations and share such information broadly. If optimized and expanded into regulatory systems in the United States and Canada, other policymaking bodies, and businesses, the essential-use approach can improve chemicals management and shift the market toward safer chemistries that benefit human and ecological health.","The authors gratefully thank Ian Cousins, Avi Kar, David Lennett, Mark Miller, Andre?Å Algazi, and Joel Tickner for their helpful comments on early versions of the manuscript and Tom Bruton for his early contributions to the concepts in the Perspective.

By mapping the DT literature in the area of marketing, 117 articles, published between 2014 and 2020, have been identified. Through the adoption of a content analysis process, a multi-dimensional framework synthesizing the DT and marketing binomial has been provided. Results identify two thematical patterns: the macro-themes, related to the main digital technologies adopted within the marketing function, and the micro-themes, related to the effect/impact of these technologies on marketing processes and activities. Concerning the micro-themes, findings show how they have mainly studied from the customer and business processesÉ?? perspectives, thus identifying an interesting research gap related to the analysis of the DT-marketing phenomenon from the employeesÉ?? standpoint. Based on these results, the paper derives a research agenda by also providing theoretical and managerial implications. Theoretically, it is the first systematic and thematic review focused on DT and marketing. In particular, it analyses this binomial from a broad and comprehensive perspective, thus offering a synergistic framework of the existing literature, which allows an inclusive vision and understanding about the phenomenon. At the managerial level, the paper could help organizations to enhance their awareness about marketing areas and processes that could better benefit from digitalization, thus driving the overall transition of firms towards DT.","This publication includes, among the authors, a researcher awarded with a fixed-term type A research contract on innovation topics as per art. 24, para. 3, of Italian Law no. 240 of 30 December 2010, co-financed by the European UnionÉ??NOP Research and Innovation 2014-2020 resources as per Italian MD no. 1062 of 10 August 2021.",Open access funding provided by Universit?ˇ degli Studi di Urbino Carlo Bo within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.,Italian Journal of Marketing,,,,45000,2023,45000,45078,2023,2,207-288,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Cioppi, Marco; Curina, Ilaria; Francioni, Barbara; Savelli, Elisabetta","Cioppi, Marco (Department of Communication Sciences, Humanities and International Studies, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Via Saffi 15, 61029, Urbino, Italy); Curina, Ilaria (Department of Communication Sciences, Humanities and International Studies, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Via Saffi 15, 61029, Urbino, Italy); Francioni, Barbara (Department of Communication Sciences, Humanities and International Studies, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Via Saffi 15, 61029, Urbino, Italy); Savelli, Elisabetta (Department of Economics, Society, Politics, University of Urbino Carlo Bo, Via Saffi, 42, 61029, Urbino, Italy)","Curina, Ilaria (University of Urbino)","Cioppi, Marco (University of Urbino); Curina, Ilaria (University of Urbino); Francioni, Barbara (University of Urbino); Savelli, Elisabetta (University of Urbino)",2,2,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s43039-023-00067-2.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156184896,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 3506 Marketing; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

Then, a novel robust possibilistic programming (RPP) approach is presented using credibility measure and membership functions of generalized interval-valued type-2 fuzzy variables to face the epistemic uncertainties, such as supply capacity of facilities, customer demand, transportation cost, and CO2 emission factor, in the proposed mathematical model. An improved version of augmented ?Ê-constraint method (AUGMECON2) is also employed to produce separate Pareto-optimal solutions. Moreover, the study compares the proposed RPP with possibilistic chance-constrained programming model and illustrates its advantages; in the standard deviation of CO2 emission objective function, its performance has improved by about 44.91%.

To manage this complexity, organizations must identify the optimum number of suppliers. There have been many examples in the literature that used different approaches to solve this problem. Despite the importance of this issue, less attention has been paid to it and managers of the companies do not know how, and based on which approach and criteria, they should determine the optimal number of suppliers which leads to lower cost and higher reliability of the production line. Therefore, in this study, a hybrid methodology is proposed to expose the process of this problem which helps managers to learn how they can determine the optimal number of suppliers. We address this gap by developing an integrated approach based on multi-criteria decision-making?ˇ(MCDM) comprising best-worst method?ˇ(BWM), simple additive weighting?ˇ(SAW), and technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution?ˇ(TOPSIS), and simulation to determine the optimal number of suppliers. This study utilizes a comprehensive approach based on leagile and environmentally sustainable criteria to determine the optimal number of suppliers. To examine the efficiency of the proposed approach, an empirical case study is conducted in an Iranian oil company. The final results represent that the scenario with a 1-1-1 arrangement (one supplier for each type of equipment) is the best possible scenario to determine the optimal number of leagile-sustainable suppliers. To examine the reliability and robustness of the obtained results, a sensitivity analysis based on the three most important criteria is conducted. Finally, discussions on the findings as well as theoretical and managerial implications are presented.","The research was partially supported by the Faculty of Informatics and Management UHK specific research project 2107 Integration of Departmental Research Activities and StudentsÉ??

In addition, since companies prefer buying their needs from a group of suppliers, the problem of supplier selection is not solely choosing or qualifying a supplier from among others. Buyers, hence, commonly assemble a portfolio of suppliers by looking at the multi-dimensional pre-determined selection criteria. Since sustainable supplier selection criteria are often assessed by linguistic terms, an appropriate clustering approach is required. This paper presents an innovative way to implement fuzzy equivalence relation to clustering sustainable suppliers through developing a comprehensive taxonomy of sustainable supplier selection criteria, including supply chain risk. Fifteen experts participated in this study to evaluate 20 suppliers and cluster them in the plastics industry. Findings reveal that the best partitioning occurs when the suppliers are divided into two clusters, with 4 (20%) and 16 (80%) suppliers, respectively. The four suppliers in cluster one are performing better in terms of the capability of supplier/delivery, service, risk, and sustainability criteria such as environment protection/management, and green innovation. These factors are critical in clustering and selecting sustainable suppliers. The originality of this study lies in developing an all-inclusive set of criteria for clustering sustainable suppliers and adding risk factors to the conventional supplier selection criteria. In addition to partitioning the suppliers and determining the best-performing ones, this study also highlights the most influential factors by analysing the suppliers in the best cluster.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Journal of Environmental Management,,,Cluster Analysis; Industry; Plastics; Risk Factors,45169,2023,45169,2023-11,345,,118811,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Kiani Mavi, Reza; Zarbakhshnia, Navid; Kiani Mavi, Neda; Kazemi, Sajad","Kiani Mavi, Reza (School of Business and Law, Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, WA, 6027, Australia.

In emerging industries such as disaster safety industry, there is a scarcity of information regarding intra-industry transactions, and the industry's scope is often vague, thereby restricting comprehensive analysis. To address this issue, we constructed a quasi-business transaction network that aggregates firm level data to regional level. A correlation analysis using location quotients (LQ) was conducted to determine the relationship with the existing industry. The disaster safety industry network was highly correlated with regional demand. The cluster analysis results showed that four clusters were derived around large cities in the region, which was statistically significant. As a result, these cluster formations were statistically significantly correlated with science- and technology-related industries. Although the disaster safety industry was fostered by the government, we confirmed that technological innovation based on existing industries related to science-based technology can also promote the development of the disaster safety industry.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

It has led firms to rethink and rework their existing robust and resilient supply chains. The purpose of this study is to move beyond robustness and resilience and shift to an antifragile supply chain that sees disorder as an opportunity to learn and grow. In this study, various factors to attain an antifragile supply chain have been identified through literature review and expertsÉ?? opinions. Using TISM-MICMAC, structural relationships among these factors have been developed, and, then the factors have been classified as drivers or dependents. The study reveals the importance of having proactive top management as a major driving power to build an antifragile supply chain. Development of a strategy for collaboration and innovation, development of a skilled workforce for technology adoption, and resource allocation for digitalization are some other factors with strong driving power. The novelty of the study lies in its effort to drive the attention of researchers and practitioners towards thinking beyond robustness and resilience and shifting towards antifragility. The study will help firms in strategic decision-making for the adoption of additive manufacturing technology to develop antifragility in the supply chain and save itself from negative consequences in the face of disruption.",Authors would like to express sincere thanks to the Editor and anonymous reviewers for giving valuable comments and suggestions to improve the quality of this paper.,,Operations Management Research,,,,44678,2022,44678,2022-06,15,45293,567-588,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Priyadarshini, Jaya; Singh, Rajesh Kr; Mishra, Ruchi; Bag, Surajit","Priyadarshini, Jaya (Management Development Institute (MDI), Gurgaon, India); Singh, Rajesh Kr (Management Development Institute (MDI), Gurgaon, India); Mishra, Ruchi (Institute of Rural Management Anand (IRMA), Anand, India); Bag, Surajit (Department of Transport and Supply Chain Management, University of Johanensburg, Johanensburg, South Africa)","Singh, Rajesh Kr (Management Development Institute)","Priyadarshini, Jaya (Management Development Institute); Singh, Rajesh Kr (Management Development Institute); Mishra, Ruchi (Institute of Rural Management Anand); Bag, Surajit (Department of Transport and Supply Chain Management, University of Johanensburg, Johanensburg, South Africa)",27,27,,21.43,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12063-022-00259-7.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147366008,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains","9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

The inconsistent demands, product consumption and the shorter lifecycle of products during the pandemic needs appropriate planning and designing to make the supply chain more resilient. In this study, an analytical model is proposed to assess the resilience of supply chain to overcome the effect of the disruption impacts. The supply chain risks will depend on the nature of the business and therefore, besides literature review on supply chain resilience the inputs from experts were required. The interdependency among the indicators was analysed by employing Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) and demonstrated with the help of a framework. The strength of the interdependence is assessed using Bayesian Network approach. BN transformed the qualitative expert inputs to quantitative assessment by utilising the principles of conditional probability. Three cases from Indian manufacturing industries were used to demonstrate and assess the critical supply chain resilience indicators using integrated ISM-BN approach. The cases showed that the proposed approach can assist decision makers in identifying the critical indicators to be focused towards improving the supply chain resilience to overcome the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic. A comparative analysis of the supply chain risk indicators has also been performed, thereby extending the practical implication of supply chain resilience.",,,Operations Management Research,,,,44678,2022,44678,2022-12,15,45355,1161-1180,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Badhotiya, Gaurav Kumar; Soni, Gunjan; Jain, Vipul; Joshi, Rohit; Mittal, Sameer","Badhotiya, Gaurav Kumar (Mechanical Engineering Department, Graphic Era (Deemed to be University), Dehradun, Uttarakhand, India); Soni, Gunjan (Mechanical Engineering Department, Malaviya National Institute of Technology, Jaipur, Rajasthan, India); Jain, Vipul (School of Management, Victoria University of Wellington, Wellington, New Zealand); Joshi, Rohit (Indian Institute of Management, Shillong, Meghalaya, India); Mittal, Sameer (Institute of Management, JK Lakshmipath University, Jaipur, India; Unit of Information and Knowledge Management, Tampere University, Tampere, Finland)","Soni, Gunjan (Malaviya National Institute of Technology Jaipur)","Badhotiya, Gaurav Kumar (Graphic Era University); Soni, Gunjan (Malaviya National Institute of Technology Jaipur); Jain, Vipul (Victoria University of Wellington); Joshi, Rohit (Indian Institute of Management Shillong); Mittal, Sameer (Institute of Management, JK Lakshmipath University, Jaipur, India; Tampere University)",18,18,,14.29,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12063-021-00236-6.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147366010,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains","12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

In this regard, the supply chain of healthcare centers should put all of their efforts into avoiding any shortages of masks and shields as these products are considered as primary ways to prevent the spread of the virus. Since, any shortages in these products would lead to irrecoverable and costly consequences in terms of the mortality rate of patients and medical staff. Therefore, healthcare centers should decide on best supplier to supply required products, considering technical, and sustainability measures. Dynamicity and uncertainty of the pandemic are other factors that add up to the complexity of the supplier selection problem. Therefore, this paper develops a novel decision-making approach using Measuring attractiveness through a categorical-based evaluation technique (MACBETH) and a new combinative distance-based assessment method to address the supplier selection problem during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to high uncertainty, vague and incomplete information for decision-making problems during the COVID-19 pandemic, the developed decision-making approach is implemented under fuzzy rough numbers as a superior uncertainty set of the traditional fuzzy set and rough numbers. Extensive sensitivity analysis tests are performed based on parameters of the decision-making approach, impacts of weight coefficients, and consistency of results in comparison to other MCDM methods. A real-life case study is investigated for a hospital in Istanbul, Turkey to show the applicability of the developed approach. Based on the results of MACBETH method, job creation and occupational health and safety systems are two top criteria. Results of the case study for five suppliers indicate that supplier (A1) is the best supplier with a distance score of 3.308.",,,Annals of Operations Research,,,,44573,2022,44573,2023-09,328,1,977-1019,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Pamucar, Dragan; Torkayesh, Ali Ebadi; Biswas, Sanjib","Pamucar, Dragan (Department of Logistics, Military Academy, University of Defence in Belgrade, 11000, Belgrade, Serbia); Torkayesh, Ali Ebadi (School of Business and Economics, RWTH Aachen University, 52072, Aachen, Germany); Biswas, Sanjib (Decision Sciences and Operations Management Area, Calcutta Business School, 743503, Bishnupur, South 24 Parganas, West Bengal, India)","Torkayesh, Ali Ebadi (RWTH Aachen University)","Pamucar, Dragan (University of Defence); Torkayesh, Ali Ebadi (RWTH Aachen University); Biswas, Sanjib (Decision Sciences and Operations Management Area, Calcutta Business School, 743503, Bishnupur, South 24 Parganas, West Bengal, India)",78,78,4.02,74.3,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10479-022-04529-2.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144615827,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 49 Mathematical Sciences; 4901 Applied Mathematics",3 Good Health and Well Being

While the dominance of the Global North in published research and public attention may suggest that this practice is universally well-developed, many Global South jurisdictions are at a stark disadvantage in resourcing and technological capabilities. Continued development of forensic science as an international endeavour requires a narrowing of inequalities between jurisdictions, in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. Here we propose a framework of principles for the sustainable provision of transparent, high-quality forensic services meeting jurisdictional needs and limitations. We illustrate how this concept of 'frugal forensics' can be applied in the context of latent fingermark detection in two Global South jurisdictions, and how quality assurance frameworks can be developed to support this service.","JTB is supported by a postgraduate scholarship from the Government of Seychelles and TL is supported by a Curtin ATN-South American Scholarship.

In this study, the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (wiiw) sheds light on the immediate consequences on the one hand, but also on the medium-term structural changes caused by the largest armed conflict in Europe since the Second World War. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has triggered a humanitarian crisis. Pre-war, almost 19?ˇm people lived in those regions that are currently directly affected. Refugee inflows to the rest of Europe are likely to be at least three times greater than in 2015/2016. As Black Sea ports come under Russian assault, Ukraine has lost its ability to sell more than half of its exports, primarily agricultural commodities and metals. Western financial support will become ever more important as the war continues. Turning to Russia, sanctions will have a very serious impact on that countryÉ??s economy and financial sector. Despite being partly hamstrung by the fact that a large proportion of Russian reserve assets are frozen in the EU and G7, the central bank managed to stabilise financial markets by a combination of confidence-building and hard-steering measures: capital controls, FX controls, regulatory easing for financial institutions, and a doubling of the key policy rate. The medium-term and long-term outlook is negative. As a result of the war and the sanctions, the rest of Europe faces a surge in already high inflation; this will weigh on real incomes and will depress economic growth. Many European countries rely heavily on Russia for oil and gas imports: import shares are over 75% in Czechia, Latvia, Hungary, Slovakia, and Bulgaria with respect to natural gas; Slovakia, Lithuania, Poland, and Finland with respect to oil and petroleum; and Cyprus, Estonia, Latvia, Denmark, Lithuania, Greece, and Bulgaria with respect to solid fuels. Aside from energy, the fallout via trade for the rest of Europe is likely to be small. Non-energy trade and investment links between Russia and many European countries have declined in importance since 2013. There are four main areas of structural change and lasting impact for the EU (and Europe more broadly) as a result of RussiaÉ??s invasion of Ukraine. First, the EU will get more serious about defence. Second, the green transition will gather pace. Third, broader Eurasian economic integration will be unwound. And fourth, the EU accession prospects for countries in Southeast Europe could (and should) improve.",,,International Economics and Economic Policy,,,,2022-05,2022,44735,2022-05,19,2,331-381,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Astrov, Vasily; Ghodsi, Mahdi; Grieveson, Richard; Holzner, Mario; Kochnev, Artem; Landesmann, Michael; Pindyuk, Olga; Stehrer, Robert; Tverdostup, Maryna; Bykova, Alexandra","Astrov, Vasily (The Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (Wiiw), Rahlgasse 3, 1060, Vienna, Austria); Ghodsi, Mahdi (The Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (Wiiw), Rahlgasse 3, 1060, Vienna, Austria); Grieveson, Richard (The Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (Wiiw), Rahlgasse 3, 1060, Vienna, Austria); Holzner, Mario (The Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (Wiiw), Rahlgasse 3, 1060, Vienna, Austria); Kochnev, Artem (The Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (Wiiw), Rahlgasse 3, 1060, Vienna, Austria); Landesmann, Michael (The Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (Wiiw), Rahlgasse 3, 1060, Vienna, Austria); Pindyuk, Olga (The Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (Wiiw), Rahlgasse 3, 1060, Vienna, Austria); Stehrer, Robert (The Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (Wiiw), Rahlgasse 3, 1060, Vienna, Austria); Tverdostup, Maryna (The Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (Wiiw), Rahlgasse 3, 1060, Vienna, Austria); Bykova, Alexandra (The Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies (Wiiw), Rahlgasse 3, 1060, Vienna, Austria)","Landesmann, Michael (Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies)","Astrov, Vasily (Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies); Ghodsi, Mahdi (Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies); Grieveson, Richard (Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies); Holzner, Mario (Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies); Kochnev, Artem (Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies); Landesmann, Michael (Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies); Pindyuk, Olga (Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies); Stehrer, Robert (Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies); Tverdostup, Maryna (Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies); Bykova, Alexandra (Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies)",59,59,,57.88,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10368-022-00546-5.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148894018,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics; 3802 Econometrics","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

word counting data, and discrete regression modeling to study the relationship
between demand behaviors and supply issues affecting supply chain resilience
during the first stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. The work used news and media
articles gathered from the LexisNexis database covering 5 months between
February and July 2020. The data analyses describe the general patterns in the
news texts by using text mining techniques, and the methodology describes the
relationship between consumer behavior, supply chain issues, and the reduced
level of service shown during the study period. Demand behaviors include
precautionary and opportunistic buying, which affected many countries and could
be the result of a lack of perceived control and other factors; for example,
near-empty shelves of certain products could have prompted consumers to
increasingly look for comparable products, driving up demand. Additionally, the
method explored the potential effect of strategies to mitigate impacts on the
resilience of supply chains. The results confirmed that buying behaviors and a
reduction in the capacity of the supply chain led to a lower level of service
being perceived by consumers, however, resilience strategies were found to
mitigate the impact of such capacity reductions. Empirical analyses showed that
the proposed approach, using data extracted from the news, could identify and
represent impacts consistent with expectations from the supply chain field under
disruptions, and quantify the magnitude of the impacts as the pandemic evolved,
providing more information for decision making.",,"Funding: The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: This study was funded by a grant from U.S. Department of Transportation through the Center for Transportation, Environment, and Community Health at the University of California, Davis.",Transportation Research Record Journal of the Transportation Research Board,,,,44840,2022,44840,,,,3.61198E+15,All OA; Green,Article,"Rivera-Royero, Daniel; Jaller, Miguel; Jenn, Alan","Rivera-Royero, Daniel (Institute of Transportation Studies, University of California, Davis, CA); Jaller, Miguel (Sustainable Freight Research Program, Institute of Transportation Studies, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Davis, CA); Jenn, Alan (Plug-in Hybrid and Electric Vehicle (PH&EV), Institute of Transportation Studies, University of California, Davis, CA)","Jaller, Miguel (University of California, Davis)","Rivera-Royero, Daniel (University of California, Davis); Jaller, Miguel (University of California, Davis); Jenn, Alan (University of California, Davis)",2,2,,1.59,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9548507,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151637919,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",

Substantial emissions reduction in agrifood systems is critical to achieving the temperature goal set by the Paris Agreement. A key challenge in reducing GHG emissions in the agrifood value chain is the imbalanced allocation of benefits and costs associated with emissions reduction among agrifood value chain participants. However, only a few studies have examined agrifood emissions reduction from a value chain perspective, especially using dynamic methods to investigate participants' long-term emissions reduction strategies. This paper helps fill this gap in the existing literature by examining the impact of collaborations among agrifood value chain participants on correcting those misallocations and reducing emissions in agrifood systems. We develop a dynamic differential game model to examine participants' long-term emissions reduction strategies in a three-stage agrifood value chain. We use the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation to derive the Nash equilibrium emissions reduction strategies under non-cooperative, cost-sharing, and cooperative mechanisms. We then conduct numerical analysis and sensitivity analysis to validate our model. Our results show that collaboration among value chain participants leads to higher emissions reduction efforts and profits for the entire value chain. Specifically, based on our numerical results, the cooperative mechanism results in the greatest emissions reduction effort by the three participants, which leads to a total that is nearly three times higher than that of the non-cooperative mechanism and close to two times higher than the cost-sharing mechanism. The cooperative mechanism also recorded the highest profits for the entire value chain, surpassing the non-cooperative and cost-sharing mechanisms by around 37% and 16%, respectively. Our results provide valuable insights for policymakers and agrifood industry stakeholders to develop strategies and policies encouraging emissions reduction collaborations in the agrifood value chain and reduce emissions in the agrifood systems.",We acknowledge the editor and the anonymous reviewers that contributed to improving the quality of the original version of this work.,"HW acknowledges the China Scholarship Council (CSC) 202207090060 for the financial support for her Ph.D. study.

We received answers from several of these firms using a survey form sent and emailed to them. The replies were then assessed using an independent t test to account for any biases. We used confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for the validity assessment, compound consistency, and corrected-item-total association measures to validate the modelÉ??s validity and reliability. According to our research, SMEs are influenced significantly by societal pressures, green economic incentives, and environmental dedication when deciding whether to adopt CE practices. Our study further emphasizes the importance of SSCM for SMEsÉ?? successful transition to a CE model, especially regarding resource and waste management efficiency. This work contributes to the corpus of research on the topic by providing empirical support for the function of SSCM in easing the transition towards CE in the setting of SMEs. The results might serve as a reference for managers and policymakers as they create plans to encourage SMEs to embrace CE practices and to emphasize the advantages of such a change on the economic, social, and environmental fronts. Putting a particular emphasis on the vital roles that public pressure, green financial incentives, and ecological dedication play, this research provides insights into the complex interactions between SSCM and CE transition in SMEs.

This paper aimed to update the industry model of Chinese Manufacturing Enterprises (CMEs) to improve workers' health management. This work first discusses the value, mode, and process of Enterprise Digital Transformation (EDT) and Worker Health and Safety Management (WHSM). Then, it proposes the CMEs-oriented EDT model and WHSM system based on Big Data Technology (BDT) and the Internet of Things (IoT). The proposed model and system are verified through a case study on the Shanghai BYD manufacturing enterprise (short for BYD) using the Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation Method (CFEM). The EDT model verification considers the adaptation and performance of enterprises after EDT.

For companies, SCM operations are becoming more important than manufacturing, sales, and marketing activities, and new ways and methods are preferred for efficiency and performance. The agility (or agility phenomenon) is one of the applications that aids effective SCM operations in this context. Agile Supply Chain Management (ASCM) and the emergence of Industry 4.0 practices, in addition to offering a cost advantage and business performance improvement, are crucial in providing flexibility to companies and ensuring their survival in the era of Industry 4.0. Meanwhile, companies aim to deal with uncertainty and implement various risk-reduction strategies as part of effective SCM. In this context, the study lists the critical success factors of ASCM and selects the most appropriate risk reduction strategy for companies that manufacture and market rubber and plastic products with a corporate identity and conduct import and export business in Istanbul.

These NdFeB magnets, which are sensitive to demagnetization with temperature elevation (the Curie point), require the addition of variable amounts of dysprosium (Dy), where an elevation of the Curie point is needed to meet operational conditions. Given that China is the world's largest REE supplier with abundant REE reserves, the impact of an ambitious 1.5 ?¯C climate target on China's Dy supply chain has sparked widespread concern. Here, we explore future trends and innovation strategies associated with the linkage between Dy and NdFeBs under various climate scenarios in China. We find China alone is expected to exhaust the global present Dy reserve within the next 2-3 decades to facilitate the 1.5 ?¯C climate target. By implementing global available innovation strategies, such as material substitution, reduction, and recycling, it is possible to avoid 48%-68% of China's cumulative demand for Dy. Nevertheless, ongoing efforts in REE exploration and production are still required to meet China's growing Dy demand, which will face competition from the United States, European Union, and other countries with ambitious climate targets. Thus, our analysis urges China and those nations to form wider cooperation in REE supply chains as well as in NdFeB innovation for the realization of a global climate-safe future.","This study is funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2021YFC2901801), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 71961147003, and 72274187, 72088101), as well as two industrial projects (No. 20224ABC03W05 and BFXT-2021-D-00061).",,Environmental Science and Technology,,,"Dysprosium; Metals, Rare Earth; Climate; Magnets; China",45183,2023,45183,45195,57,38,14113-14126,Closed,Article,"Dai, Tao; Liu, Yan-Fei; Wang, Peng; Qiu, Yang; Mancheri, Nabeel; Chen, Wei; Liu, Jun-Xi; Chen, Wei-Qiang; Wang, Heming; Wang, An-Jian","Dai, Tao (Institute of Mineral Resource, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, Beijing, 100037, China; Research Center for Strategy of Global Mineral Resources, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, Beijing, 100037, China); Liu, Yan-Fei (School of Earth Sciences and Resources, China University of Geosciences (Beijing), Beijing, 100083, China); Wang, Peng (Key Lab of Urban Environment and Health, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen, 361021, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China); Qiu, Yang (Joint Global Change Research Institute, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, 5825 University Research Court, Suite 3500, College Park, Maryland, 20740, United States); Mancheri, Nabeel (Rare Earth Industry Association, Diestsevest 14, 3000, Leuven, Belgium); Chen, Wei (University of Science and Technology of China, Hefei, 230026, China); Liu, Jun-Xi (Department of Materials Engineering, Graduate School of Engineering, The University Tokyo (Hongo Campus), 113-8654, 7 Chome-3-1 Hongo, Bunkyo City, Tokyo, Japan); Chen, Wei-Qiang (Key Lab of Urban Environment and Health, Institute of Urban Environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Xiamen, 361021, China; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China); Wang, Heming (State Environmental Protection Key Laboratory of Eco-Industry, Northeastern University, Shenyang, Liaoning, 110819, China); Wang, An-Jian (Institute of Mineral Resource, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, Beijing, 100037, China; Research Center for Strategy of Global Mineral Resources, Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, Beijing, 100037, China)","Wang, Peng (Institute of Urban Environment; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences); Chen, Wei-Qiang (Institute of Urban Environment; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences); Wang, An-Jian (Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences; Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences)","Dai, Tao (Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences; Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences); Liu, Yan-Fei (China University of Geosciences); Wang, Peng (Institute of Urban Environment; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences); Qiu, Yang (Joint Global Change Research Institute); Mancheri, Nabeel (Rare Earth Industry Association, Diestsevest 14, 3000, Leuven, Belgium); Chen, Wei (University of Science and Technology of China); Liu, Jun-Xi (The University of Tokyo); Chen, Wei-Qiang (Institute of Urban Environment; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences); Wang, Heming (Northeastern University); Wang, An-Jian (Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences; Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences)",1,1,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164099682,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 37 Earth Sciences",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

This article proposes a model rooted in sociological concepts (work organisation, control, and risk) to analyse how social relations of work and employment are structured, and how inequalities are manufactured, in these organisational forms. First, we change the level of analysis, moving from firm to productive configuration. Second, we propose the notion of social labour relations, to grasp the relationship between workers and any entity likely to control their conditions of work and employment. Social labour relations articulates five dimensions that could be used to compare groups of workers who are participating in the same configuration. Third, we analyse how control is exercised by which entity/entities and over which social labour relation dimension. Such an understanding is essential to provide avenues for institutional renewal: namely to reconnect control and responsibility.","The authors thank Cathy Belzile and Marie-H??l??ne Deshaies for their participation in the collection and analysis of data on the poultry value chain in Quebec, and the Editor and two anonymous reviewers for their relevant suggestions.","Funding The authors disclosed receipt of the following financial support for the research, authorship, and/or publication of this article: The research project was funded by the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC), Insight Grant no. 435-2014-1404.",Work Employment and Society,,,,44746,2022,44746,2024-02,38,1,63-82,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"DÉ??Amours, Martine; Pogliaghi, Leticia; Bellemare, Guy; Briand, Louise; Hanin, Fr??d??ric","DÉ??Amours, Martine (Universit??

Furthermore, three supply resilience capabilities, absorbing, responding and capitalizing, should be prioritized in supply chains for responding to and recovering from global crises and disruptions. Supply resilience is key to crisis response and recovery, and PSM has an essential role in building and sustaining that resilience.","We would like to thank all the authors for their contributions and the reviewers for their feedback provided to the authors.

Recent crises, such as the coronavirus outbreaks, large-scale product recalls, and financial crises, underscore the increasing regularity and severity of crises with imperatives for introspective and retrospective socio-economic insights on the contexts, priorities, and themes of supply chain management in times of crisis. The purpose of this article is to review the literature on supply chain management in times of crisis, systematically coalescing the related body of scholarly work; outlining current methods applied by researchers; capturing strategic priorities and themes of complexities in research studies; and highlighting potentials for future studies. Using a systematic review of 250 journal articles published between 1996 and 2021, the review finds four dimensions for restorative priorities that reflect operations strategy during crisis: (i) critical supplies with essential services, (ii) timely response with recovery, (iii) safety with security, and (iv) traceability with transparency. The review also finds that operational complexities during crises originate from network configurations and business cycle complexities, optimal selections and provisioning system complexes, and complex learning processes and demand predictions. Insights from the review aid in the proposal of build-to-cycle, organic capabilities, and operational mindfulness framings for supply chain management in times of crisis.

Resilient supply chains have become a key issue for manufacturing companies to ensure a stable supply for their manufacturing processes and for governments to ensure the stable supply of essential goods to society. Building diversified supply chains and monitoring the performance of suppliers are major mitigation strategies to counteract disruptions at an early stage. Supply chain risk management and monitoring of supply chains using big data analytics are getting increasing attention. The growing number of data sources has huge implications on the reporting of incidents that may disrupt supply chains. The data sources may stem from a variety of internet sources like daily media reports provided on websites, social media or specialist media, or they may stem from specific databases. The sooner this information is disclosed to stakeholders and analysed the better the preventive strategies generally are. Timely information prolongs the reaction time and may help to reduce the severity of an incident. This paper highlights a science-based real-time tracking analysis of risks in the mineral raw material markets for the period 2019 to 2021 using big data analytics provided by a commercial system. A set of data for 12 selected mineral raw materials was provided by the authors and analysed using more than 100 risk indicators from 14 major risk categories as part of a commercial big data system. The extracted information can have imminent value to identify supply shortages, production halts or price peaks at an early stage. The main question was to find out whether such big data analytics are precise enough to detect potential, globally relevant, supply shortages in mineral raw material markets in due time. The results of this paper show that using big data analytics can be a very effective tool to extract relevant information about supply sources and to react timely in case of disruptions or social or environmental mismanagement on the supplier side. However, the nature of big data sources suggests that the parameters of the applied models need elaborate configuration. Each raw mineral market has its own peculiarities in terms of volume, mode of transport, market concentration or countries of origin. These factors influence the relevance of the reported incidents. Furthermore, some incidents have a spurious or only minor connection to the individual markets. For these reasons, we conclude that only supervised models reap the most benefits in the monitoring of mineral raw material markets.",We would like to thank the reviewers of this paper for their valuable contributions and helpful comments.

But the mechanism and impact of digital transformation on total factor productivity (TFP) of firms is still unclear and this study is intended to fill this gap using the data of 3112 listed firms of China during 2011 to 2022. We applied various econometric techniques like stepwise regression analysis, instrumental variable approach, differences in difference approach, and mediating analysis to determine the relationship between digital transformation and TFP and robustness of estimated findings. The findings indicate that DGT has a positive impact on overall TFP of firms in China while operating efficiency, cheaper costs, and a stronger capacity for innovation mediates this relationship. Moreover, it is explored that conventional information and communication technologies have not significant impact on TFP of firms. The findings of the study remain valid even applying many robustness checks and attempts to control the issue of endogeneity. To fully leverage the potential benefits of digital transformation on TFP, it is essential to focus on enhancing digital literacy and skills among the workforce. Governments and relevant stakeholders should prioritize and invest in comprehensive digital literacy and skills training programs to empower the workforce with the knowledge and expertise needed to navigate the digital age effectively.",,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Muhammad Usman Tariq,"China; Communication; Government; Information Technology; Digital Technology; Efficiency, Organizational; Workforce",45329,2024,45329,,19,2,e0298428,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fu, Zhiyuan; Madni, Ghulam Rasool","Fu, Zhiyuan (Institute of Electronic Commerce, Zhejiang Business College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China); Madni, Ghulam Rasool (Department of Economics, Division of Management and Administrative Science, University of Education, Lahore, Pakistan)","Madni, Ghulam Rasool (University of Education)","Fu, Zhiyuan (Institute of Electronic Commerce, Zhejiang Business College, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China); Madni, Ghulam Rasool (University of Education)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0298428&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168623287,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 46 Information and Computing Sciences",

The United States CHIPS and Science Act epitomizes the countryÉ??s recent embrace of techno-nationalism in its economic rivalry with China, which has major implications for IB scholarship and management practice. The Act exhibits two features that fly against AmericaÉ??s traditional liberal policy stance of championing an open and rules-based multilateral system. First, its reliance on subsidies, export control, and investment screening signifies departure from free trade and from market-based industrial policies. Second, its use of guardrail provisions pursues the weaponization of global value chains for geopolitical and geo-economic purposes. We view the Act as a showcase of a paradigm shift from market-oriented liberalism to intervention-oriented techno-nationalism, heralding a new era of zero-sum thinking and geopolitical prioritization. By examining the broader trend of techno-nationalism, we explore the distinct features of the Act and analyze the geo-strategies that MNEs need to adopt in response to the resulting techno-geopolitical uncertainty. Our analysis highlights the paradigm shift in policymaking, identifies the root causes of this shift, and examines the potential pitfalls it may create. To navigate this uncertain landscape, we suggest four strategic responses for MNEs: geo-strategies, reconfiguration, resilience, and corporate diplomacy.",The authors are grateful to Professor Rosalie Tung and the three anonymous reviewers for their excellent comments and suggestions.,,Journal of International Business Studies,,,,45017,2023,45017,2023-10,54,8,1423-1440,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Luo, Yadong; Van Assche, Ari","Luo, Yadong (Miami Herbert Business School, University of Miami, 33146, Coral Gables, FL, USA); Van Assche, Ari (Department of International Business, HEC Montr??al, H3T 2A7, Montreal, QC, Canada)","Luo, Yadong (University of Miami)","Luo, Yadong (University of Miami); Van Assche, Ari (HEC Montr??al)",36,36,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057/s41267-023-00620-3.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156893890,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 3505 Human Resources and Industrial Relations; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

There is a need to adapt the existing supply chain models to describe the disruptions and offer the potential measures that businesses and governments can take to minimize adverse effects from a retail logistics perspective. This research analyses the possible reasons for supply and demand disruptions using a mathematical model of a retail supply chain with uncertain lead times and stochastic demand of strategic consumers. The established concepts of supply chain management are applied for the model analysis: multi-period inventory policies, bullwhip effect, and strategic consumers. The impact of the pandemic outbreaks in the model is two-fold: increased lead-time uncertainty affects supply, while consumer stockpiling affects demand. Consumers' rational hoarding and irrational panic buying significantly increase retailers' costs due to higher safety stock and demand variability. The bullwhip effect further exacerbates the disruption. The research contributes to the recent literature on business response to supply chain disruptions by developing a model where both retailers and consumers decide on the order quantity and reorder point during a pandemic outbreak. Buying limits, continuous inventory review, government rationing, substitutability, and omnichannel fulfillment are the measures that can limit the damage of supply chain disruptions from stockpiling during the pandemic. Effective communication and price and availability guarantees can mitigate the negative impact of panic buying.",The author is thankful to two anonymous reviewers for their invaluable comments that helped to improve the manuscript immensely.

It is a type of design optimization issue that exists in logistics implementations such as supply chain planning in healthcare or agriculture. Along with concerns regarding PD delivery time manner for connecting logistics centers and customers, recent studies have considered the zero-one location design model. This research discussed a route selection model for the 2S-ZOPS that did not exist in the published studies by taking into account the level of risk associated with physical appearance. The mathematical models were developed in response to a PD supply chain design that occurred in ThailandÉ??s National Health Insurance Program. By combining the virus optimization algorithm (VOA) with a large neighborhood search (LNS), we created a hybrid metaheuristic method for solving the 2S-ZOPS. Experiments with real-world data demonstrated that the hybrid algorithm was efficient in terms of time consumption and solution quality, saving approximately 6% on total costs. The presented practice benefits not only the healthcare industry but also various other businesses.","PL was supported by the research funding from Faculty of Engineering, Thammasat School of Engineering and Thammasat University Research Unit in Industrial Statistics and Operational Research, Thammasat University.

        When the COVIDÉ?ê19 pandemic began in 2020, the medical product industry faced an unusual demand shock for personal protective equipment (PPE), including face masks, face shields, disinfectants, and gowns. Companies from various industries responded to the urgent need for these potentially lifeÉ?êsaving products by adopting ad hoc supply chains in an exceptionally short time: They found new suppliers, developed the products, rampedÉ?êup production, and distributed to new customers within weeks or even days. We define these supply chains as ad hoc supply chains that are built for a specific need, an immediate need, and a timeÉ?êlimited need. By leveraging a unique sampling, we examined how companies realize supply chain agility when building ad hoc supply chains. We develop an emergent theoretical model that proposes dynamic capabilities to enable companies building ad hoc supply chains in response to a specific need, moderated by an entrepreneurial orientation allowing firms to leverage dynamic capabilities at short notice and a temporary orientation that increases a company's focus on exploiting the shortÉ?êterm opportunity of ad hoc supply chains.",,,Journal of Operations Management,,,,44791,2022,44791,2023-04,69,3,426-449,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"M?¨ller, Jasmina; Hoberg, Kai; Fransoo, Jan C.","M?¨ller, Jasmina (Department of Operations and Technology, Kuehne LogisticsUniversity, Hamburg, Germany); Hoberg, Kai (Department of Operations and Technology, Kuehne LogisticsUniversity, Hamburg, Germany); Fransoo, Jan C.

Progressively, it has attracted the attention of academicians, practitioners, and policymakers worldwide. However, there needs to be more systematic review of research in the current literature that captures the current state of this new paradigm. This study aims to address this gap by conducting a comprehensive review of Industry 4.0 previous studies to identify its technological, organisational, and managerial enablers, as well as its implementation challenges and benefits. A systematic literature review was conducted, in which 244 peer-reviewed journal papers were analysed in the Scopus database until the end of May 2022. This study excluded conference papers, book chapters, and journal papers not written in English. The study indicated that industry 4.0 is still an immature topic, and applying this new paradigm is not a matter of technology only. Organisational and managerial aspects should be considered. Additionally, the transition towards Industry 4.0 is a complex task, many obstacles exist, and manufacturing companies should be aware of these challenges for successfully implementing this new paradigm. The obtained results in this study synthesise recent studies published on Industry 4.0 and provide a comprehensive picture of Industry 4.0 and potential research directions for future research. Also, this study offers significant guidelines for managers interested in implementing Industry 4.0.",,No Funding organisation or association involved in this research.

We ask whether and how turbulent environments motivate employees to proactively engage in innovative behavior. This study argues that employees' perceptions of environmental dynamism reinforce employee proactive innovation behavior. Using a sample comprising 262 innovative employees from 40 manufacturing SMEs in Taiwan, this study tests a moderated-mediation model in which environmental dynamism is expected to increase the indirect effect of creative self-efficacy on employee innovative behavior through knowledge acquisition. The results confirm the mediating role of knowledge acquisition and the positive moderating effect of environmental dynamism.

In generalized terms, we contribute to the understanding of the effect of preparedness and recovery decisions in a pandemic setting on supply chain operations and performance. In particular, we examine the impact of inventory pre-positioning in anticipation of a pandemic and the adaptation of production-ordering policy during the pandemic. Our model combines three levels, which is not often seen jointly in operations management literature, i.e., pandemic dynamics, supply chain design, and operational production-inventory control policies. The analysis is performed for both two- and three-stage supply chains and different scenarios for pandemic dynamics (i.e., uncontrolled propagation or controlled dispersal with lockdowns). Our findings suggest that two-stage supply chains exhibit a higher vulnerability in disruption cases. However, they are exposed to a lower system inertia and show positive effects at the recovery stage. Supply chain adaptation ahead of a pandemic is more advantageous than during the pandemic when specific operational recovery policies are deployed. We show that it is instructive to avoid simultaneous changes in structural network design and operational policies since that can destabilize the production-inventory system and result in higher product shortages.",We thank the area editor and two anonymous reviewers for their insightful and invaluable comments that helped us improve the paper immensely.,,Omega,,,,44626,2022,44626,2022-07,110,,102635,All OA; Green,Article,"Rozhkov, Maxim; Ivanov, Dmitry; Blackhurst, Jennifer; Nair, Anand","Rozhkov, Maxim (Department of Operations Management and Logistics, HSE University, Moscow, Russia.); Ivanov, Dmitry (Department of Business and Economics, Berlin School of Economics and Law, Supply Chain and Operations Management Group, Berlin 10825, Germany.); Blackhurst, Jennifer (Department of Business Analytics, University of Iowa, Iowa City, USA.); Nair, Anand (Department of Supply Chain Management, Michigan State University, East Lansing, MI 48824, USA.)","Ivanov, Dmitry (Berlin School of Economics and Law); Blackhurst, Jennifer (University of Iowa)","Rozhkov, Maxim (National Research University Higher School of Economics); Ivanov, Dmitry (Berlin School of Economics and Law); Blackhurst, Jennifer (University of Iowa); Nair, Anand (Michigan State University)",99,99,3.82,89.99,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8898197,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146081656,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",

Both manufacturing and services sectors in the economies of Asia have outsourced supplies from different countries in order to gain a competitive advantage through effective value chain management. The motivations for this outsourcing are to achieve technological innovations, reduce end-product prices, and strengthen strategic competitiveness. This paper applies a supply chain approach to develop the concept of a hazard-resilient healthcare system (HRHS) and to explore ways how this might be achieved. After reviewing the current international thinking on HRHS, which has narrowly focused on building national capacities with national capabilities, it argues that a supply chain approach may provide a better, more robust, and in many ways more realistic, approach to enhance the hazard resilience of national healthcare systems. Within such an approach, capabilities of the local actors (local health authorities and healthcare providers) in a pandemic or disaster-prone situation remain important and should be further strengthened, but international support and assistance in times of emergency should also be a key plank of the system. In a changing world with more frequent high-impact pandemics and disasters, such international support need not be one way, but both ways. A system of mutual support may be developed by forming an effective international common pool of capability in responding to the health needs when a major disaster occurs anywhere in a region or globally. Even though serious limitations exist in the current thinking on HRHS, significant progress has been made on the international humanitarian assistance front, especially in the ASEAN region. While developments on this front have not been a part of the purview of the current international thinking on HRHS, it is argued that they may well form an important corner stone in a typical future national HRHS.",,,Journal of Social and Economic Development,,,,44202,2021,44202,2021-12,23,Suppl 3,582-600,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Liu, Minquan; Anbumozhi, Venkatachalam","Liu, Minquan (School of Economics and Center for Human and Economic Development Studies, Peking University, Beijing, PeopleÉ??s Republic of China); Anbumozhi, Venkatachalam (Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia (ERIA), Jakarta, Indonesia)","Liu, Minquan (Peking University)","Liu, Minquan (Peking University); Anbumozhi, Venkatachalam (Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia)",3,2,0.31,1.4,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40847-020-00134-w.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134395670,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 44 Human Society",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities; 3 Good Health and Well Being

        This study examines the heterogeneous effects of the COVIDÉ?ê19 outbreak on stock prices in China. We confirm what is already known, that the pandemic has had a significant negative impact on stock market returns. Additionally, we find, this effect is heterogeneous across industries. Second, fear sentiment can directly cause stock prices to fall and panic exacerbates the negative impact of the pandemic on stock returns. Third, and most importantly, we demonstrate the underlying mechanisms of four firm characteristics and find that those with high asset intensity, low labor intensity, high inventoryÉ?êtoÉ?êrevenue ratio, and small market value are more negatively affected than others. For laborÉ?êintensive stateÉ?êowned firms, in particular, stock performance worsened because of higher idle labor costs. Finally, we created an index to measure the relative position of an industry in the supply chain, which shows that downstream companies were more vulnerable to the effects of the pandemic.","ACKNOWLEDGMENT Toan L.

However, few attentions have been paid to the design and optimization of sustainable reverse logistics network for the recycling of retired power batteries. To this end, we develop a six-level sustainable dynamic reverse logistics network model from the perspectives of economy, environment, and society. We solve the multi-objective combinatorial optimization model to explore the layout of the sustainable reverse logistics network for retired new energy vehicle power batteries recycling. A case study is implemented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model. The results show that (a) the facility nodes near the front of the network fluctuate more by opening and closing; (b) the dynamic reverse logistics network is superior to its static counterpart; and (c) cooperation cost changes affect the transaction volume between third-party and cooperative enterprises and total network cost.","The authors thank in advance the Editor-in-Chief, Associate Editor, and anonymous referees for their time and efforts in handling and reviewing this paper.","This work was supported by the Soft Science Research Program of Sichuan Province (Grant No. 2021JDR0072), the Key Research Program of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous (Grant No. 2022B01015), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 72171182, 71801175, 71871171, and 72031009), and the Chinese National Funding of Social Sciences, China (Grant No. 20&ZD058).",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,Recycling; Electric Power Supplies; Logistic Models,44963,2023,44963,2023-04,30,16,47580-47601,Closed,Article,"Mu, Nengye; Wang, Yuanshun; Chen, Zhen-Song; Xin, Peiyuan; Deveci, Muhammet; Pedrycz, Witold","Mu, Nengye (School of Transportation and Logistics, Southwest Jiaotong University, 611756, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; College of Transportation Engineering, Xinjiang University, 830046, Urumqi, Xinjiang, China; National and Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for Intelligent Integrated Transportation, 611756, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; National Engineering Laboratory of Integrated Transportation Big Data Application Technology, 611756, Chengdu, Sichuan, China); Wang, Yuanshun (School of Transportation and Logistics, Southwest Jiaotong University, 611756, Chengdu, Sichuan, China); Chen, Zhen-Song (School of Civil Engineering, Wuhan University, 430072, Wuhan, Hubei, China); Xin, Peiyuan (School of Transportation and Logistics, Southwest Jiaotong University, 611756, Chengdu, Sichuan, China); Deveci, Muhammet (The Bartlett School of Sustainable Construction, University College London, WC1E 6BT, London, UK; Department of Industrial Engineering, Turkish Naval Academy, National Defence University, 34940, Tuzla, Istanbul, Turkey); Pedrycz, Witold (Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta, T6G 2R3, Edmonton, AB, Canada; Systems Research Institute, Polish Academy of Sciences, 00-901, Warsaw, Poland; Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering Faculty of Engineering, King Abdulaziz University, 21589, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia; Department of Computer Engineering, Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Istinye University, Sariyer, Istanbul, Turkey)","Chen, Zhen-Song (Wuhan University)","Mu, Nengye (Southwest Jiaotong University; Xinjiang University; National and Local Joint Engineering Laboratory for Intelligent Integrated Transportation, 611756, Chengdu, Sichuan, China; National Engineering Laboratory of Integrated Transportation Big Data Application Technology, 611756, Chengdu, Sichuan, China); Wang, Yuanshun (Southwest Jiaotong University); Chen, Zhen-Song (Wuhan University); Xin, Peiyuan (Southwest Jiaotong University); Deveci, Muhammet (University College London; Naval Academy); Pedrycz, Witold (University of Alberta; Systems Research Institute; King Abdulaziz University; Istinye University)",12,12,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155154037,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Carbon emissions from transportation are among the highest in the world, so it is essential to improve its efficiency. Cross-docking is a smart way to improve the efficiency of transportation operations through the optimal use of truck capacity. This paper develops a novel bi-objective mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model to determine which products should be shipped together, select the most appropriate truck among the available ones, and schedule them. It reveals a new class of cross-dock truck scheduling problems, in which products are not interchangeable and are sent to different destinations. The first objective is to minimize overall system costs, while the second is to minimize total carbon emissions. To deal with uncertainties in factors, such as costs, time, and emission rate, these parameters are considered interval numbers. Furthermore, innovative uncertain approaches are introduced under interval uncertainty based on optimistic and pessimistic Pareto solutions for solving MILP problems via epsilon-constraint and weighting methods. The proposed model and solution procedures are used for planning an operational day at a regional distribution center (RDC) of a real food and beverage company, and results are compared. The results show that the proposed epsilon-constraint method outperforms the other implemented methods in terms of quantity and variety of optimistic and pessimistic Pareto solutions. Using the newly developed procedure, the amount of carbon produced by trucks could decrease by 18% under optimistic assumptions and 44% under pessimistic assumptions. As a result of the proposed solution approaches, managers can observe how their optimism level and the importance of objective functions influence their decisions.",The authors would like to express their gratitude for the insightful and constructive comments offered by four anonymous reviewers.,,Journal of Environmental Management,,,Uncertainty; Carbon; Motor Vehicles; Transportation; Beverages,44971,2023,44971,2023-04,332,,117071,Closed,Article,"Rajabzadeh, Mohsen; Mousavi, Seyed Meysam","Rajabzadeh, Mohsen (Department of Industrial Engineering, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran.); Mousavi, Seyed Meysam (Department of Industrial Engineering, Shahed University, Tehran, Iran.

WPOs are highly innovative, created by grassroots out of ""nothing"" to deliver economic, social and environmental sustainability. Still, we do not know how such innovations are developed, and how they are disseminated and adopted by other groups. This article examines characteristics, challenges and innovations of WPOs across five countries in Latin America and East Africa. It is based on quantitative and qualitative data regarding modes of organisation and management, gender, received support, business orientations, environmental and social contributions, and innovations developed in response to multiple challenges. The paper provides a comprehensive understanding of WPOs' activities and their grassroots innovations in the Global South. The study shows how WPOs contribute significantly to the economic, social and environmental sustainability of the societies they serve as well as the wider urban societies. To start and maintain WPOs in informal settlements with a lack of infrastructure, institutional frameworks, and public and private investors is a difficult quest. WPOs take many different organisational forms depending on the complexity of local realities, ranging from advanced collective organization as cooperatives to small self-help groups and microentrepreneurs. Self-organisation into regional and national networks provides economic opportunities, autonomy and stability as well as political influence. Yet, institutional support is fundamental and the lack thereof threatens their existence. Sustaining WPOs as important providers of socio-environmental benefits through governmental and non-governmental actions is a worthwhile undertaking that builds sustainability.","This research would have been impossible without the keen contribution and engagement of the many waste pickers and their WPOs, being surveyed and interviewed.

TantalumÉ??s high melting point and ability to store and release electrical charges have attracted high-tech companies since its usage in capacitors began in the 1930s. During the COVID-19 pandemic lockdown, daily life relied on electronic equipment, resulting in a surge in demand for electronic and communication gadgets, which could necessitate many tantalum raw materials and an assured supply chain. Despite tantalumÉ??s high demand from electronic manufacturers, 5G network systems and electric vehicles are currently added to the tantalum consumer list. The authors have examined three interconnected issues linked to tantalum supply interruption, which has resulted in a growing tantalum scarcity: (1) rising demand for tantalum ores and high-tech equipment while mining activities are in decline owing to the COVID-19 pandemic; (2) tantalum ore price volatility constrains the ore supply chain; (3) the challenge of pandemics that shrink mining activities and handicap supply chain. To address the issue of supply shortage in the long-term, the authors suggest that the concerned parties may adopt new norms of reliable, stable, and transparent supply channels instead of relying on an old uncertain and volatile supply system. The authors also suggest the transformation of central African artisanal and small-scale mining (mainly in Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo) into a modern mining system with a new supply channel that can resist existing and future disruptions.",,,Mineral Economics,,,,44818,2022,44818,2023-09,36,3,535-541,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Lindagato, Philemon; Li, Yongjun; Yang, Gaoxue","Lindagato, Philemon (School of Earth Science and Resources, ChangÉ??an University, 710054, XiÉ??an, China); Li, Yongjun (School of Earth Science and Resources, ChangÉ??an University, 710054, XiÉ??an, China; Key Laboratory for the Study of Focused Magmatism and Giant Ore Deposits, MLR, 710054, XiÉ??an, China); Yang, Gaoxue (School of Earth Science and Resources, ChangÉ??an University, 710054, XiÉ??an, China; Key Laboratory for the Study of Focused Magmatism and Giant Ore Deposits, MLR, 710054, XiÉ??an, China)","Lindagato, Philemon (Chang'an University); Li, Yongjun (Chang'an University; Key Laboratory for the Study of Focused Magmatism and Giant Ore Deposits, MLR, 710054, XiÉ??an, China)","Lindagato, Philemon (Chang'an University); Li, Yongjun (Chang'an University; Key Laboratory for the Study of Focused Magmatism and Giant Ore Deposits, MLR, 710054, XiÉ??an, China); Yang, Gaoxue (Chang'an University; Key Laboratory for the Study of Focused Magmatism and Giant Ore Deposits, MLR, 710054, XiÉ??an, China)",5,5,,3.97,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13563-022-00344-0.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150987728,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 46 Information and Computing Sciences",

Russia-EU international trade relations at times of war,"In this paper, we investigate the evolution of RussiaÉ??s position in the world trade system, especially in relation to the European Union (EU). Data show that after entering into the WTO, Russia did not use this accession to develop and diversify trade flows (like China did, for example) but it augmented its specialization in fuels and raw materials, increasing its dependency on the rest of the world, and especially on European demand. Russia did not exploit its trade potential and its favorable geographic position to foster its economic development and to improve the welfare of its population. At the same time, the integration within the European Single Market and with the rest of the world both for older and new EU member formerly linked to the Soviet Union, has helped the EU to maintain high standards of living, and a relative stability, even if increasing its dependency on Russian fuels. We argue that it is also because of these differences and the related economic problems that tensions between Russia and the EU grew over time.","The author thanks participants to seminars at Politecnico di Milano, Universit?ˇ Politecnica delle Marche and Universit?ˇ di Urbino, and especially two anonymous referees for helpful comments and suggestions on a preliminary version of this work.",Open access funding provided by Politecnico di Milano within the CRUI-CARE Agreement.,Journal of Industrial and Business Economics,,,,44829,2022,44829,2022-12,49,4,807-834,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Tajoli, Lucia","Tajoli, Lucia (Department of Management, Economics and Industrial Engineering, Politecnico di Milano, Milan, Italy)","Tajoli, Lucia (Politecnico di Milano)","Tajoli, Lucia (Politecnico di Milano)",6,6,,6.43,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40812-022-00232-2.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151314646,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The study probes into a series of internal measures and plans set out by MSMEs to mitigate the effects of the pandemic and also dwells into the various government support provided in softening the effects of the crisis on MSMEs in sectors highly impacted by the pandemic. Based on a survey of 380 firms and 15 interviews carried out with entrepreneurs across varied economic sectors over two different time periods (that is after the first lockdown in March 2020 and after the second lockdown in March 2021), the results indicate that micro, small and medium-sized firms have been highly impacted by the pandemic with severe contractions in their overall performance. In addition to performance in domestic sales, recovery is assessed in terms of exports, investment and profits. It is observed that recovery is more difficult for male-headed businesses compared to their female counterparts. There is also clear evidence that resilience measures adopted such as a reduction in the number of working hours along with market diversification and price adjustments have proved to be effective in mitigating the impact of the crisis. One major strategy, that, however, stands out and proves to be vital for the recovery of MSMEs is the adoption of e-commerce. However, government support in terms of the wage assistance scheme does not have a statistically significant impact on the performance and recovery of MSMEs, except for a negative effect on their exports level.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors of this paper hereby declare that there is no conflict of interest associated with this work.,,Scientific African,,,,45007,2023,45007,2023-07,20,,e01651,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ragoobur, V Tandrayen; Seetanah, B; Jaffur, Z Khan; Mooneeram-Chadee, V","Ragoobur, V Tandrayen (University of Mauritius, Mauritius.); Seetanah, B (University of Mauritius, Mauritius.); Jaffur, Z Khan (University of Mauritius, Mauritius.); Mooneeram-Chadee, V (University of Mauritius, Mauritius.)","Seetanah, B (University of Mauritius)","Ragoobur, V Tandrayen (University of Mauritius); Seetanah, B (University of Mauritius); Jaffur, Z Khan (University of Mauritius); Mooneeram-Chadee, V (University of Mauritius)",2,2,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sciaf.2023.e01651,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401135,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

An analysis based on environmental information disclosure,"Climbing the dual value chain (DVC) of parallel development in global and domestic value chains is an important channel to get rid of bottom solidification. Based on the data of international input-output tables after embedding provinces and decomposing value-added flow during 2003-2012, this article provides measurement for downstream or upstream embedding and division position indexes of A-listed firms. Then, theoretical framework of environmental regulation affecting DVC embeddedness is constructed, and the Environmental Information Disclosure (EID) trial implemented in 2008 is regarded as a quasi-natural experiment. The results show that EID enhances corporate division position in DVC by weakening downstream embeddedness and increasing upstream embeddedness, domestic firms are gradually transforming from low-end manufacturers to high-end designers. The effect works with a year lag in downstream embeddedness and lags 2 years in others. Heterogeneity analysis confirms that enhancement of division position is more sensitive in resource-rich cities with high marketization or labor-intensive firms and manufacturing or service sectors. Besides, we find that environmental regulation such as EID induces technological innovation for process upgrade, product improvement for quality upgrade and allocation optimization for function upgrade to transform the role and degree of firms embedding DVC.","We gratefully acknowledge the financial support from the National Natural Science Foundation (71874207), the Annual Innovation-driven Project of Central South University (2019CX016), the project of High-end Think Tank of Central South University (2021znzk01), the project of Postgraduate Teaching Case Bank of Central South University (2021ALK14), the National Natural Science Foundation (71633006), the Project of National Social Science Fund (21ZD103, 18ZDA049 and 18ZDA061).",,Journal of Environmental Management,,,China; Commerce; Disclosure; Organizations,44792,2022,44792,2022-11,321,,115918,Closed,Article,"Zou, Han; Zhong, Mei-Rui","Zou, Han (School of Business, Central South University, Changsha, 410083, China; Institute of Metal Resources Strategy, Central South University, Changsha, 410083, China.); Zhong, Mei-Rui (School of Business, Central South University, Changsha, 410083, China; Institute of Metal Resources Strategy, Central South University, Changsha, 410083, China.

In this study, the definition and connotation of new energy and its role and specific operation in the energy transition of carbon neutrality are firstly explained. Promoting new energy development requires significant green and low-carbon investments. Taking China as an example, this paper analyzes the opportunities brought by the carbon neutral process to the field of green finance and analyzes the main features and development trends of green finance in China at present. Then this paper proposes policy recommendations to strengthen the development of green finance in China in terms of improving the green financial policy system, enhancing the supply capacity of green financial services, and optimizing the supporting environment for green financial development. Finally, this paper analyzes the measures and experiences of the United States in promoting low-carbon development and proposes countermeasures for China's low-carbon development on the basis of the five major relationships that need attention in China's carbon-neutral process. That is, strengthen the top-level design and improve the regulatory policy system; optimize the energy structure and increase the proportion of clean energy; optimize the industrial structure and reduce energy consumption in key industries; build a complete low-carbon technology system and promote low-carbon technology research and development and demonstration applications, and encourage local conditions to explore low-carbon development paths. The development of green finance can contribute to the advancement of new energy technologies, thus contributing to the achievement of carbon neutrality goals.",,"This research was funded by the National Key Research and Development Program of China (2018YFE0109600), and the Beijing Social Science Foundation Project (19JDGLA008).",Science Progress,,,Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Climate Change; Goals,2022-01,2022,44636,2022-01,105,1,3.68504E+14,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kong, Feng","Kong, Feng (College of Humanities and Development Studies, China Agricultural University, Beijing 100083, China)","Kong, Feng (China Agricultural University)","Kong, Feng (China Agricultural University)",21,21,2.75,28.14,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/00368504221086361,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146312774,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 44 Human Society; 4407 Policy and Administration",12 Responsible Consumption and Production; 13 Climate Action; 7 Affordable and Clean Energy

Based on the co-opetition game, we discuss decision strategy preference and conflict from a multi-stakeholder perspective to optimize individual profit and system efficiency. It is found that although the invasion of multi-modal operators into the market poses a threat to competition, their service effort directly affects the market demand and promotes the profits of each carrier. The free-riding and market expansion effects triggered by service effort interact with each other. However, multi-modal operators can cope with the negative impact of the free-riding effect through the service strategy and promote system efficiency optimization. Specifically, discussing each carrier's decision-making preferences for maximizing profits, we find that the multi-modal operatorsÉ?? strategy can achieve the Pareto optimal of triple-win, and the system efficiency is also optimal simultaneously.","This research was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (71774019, 71402038), National Social Science Foundation of China (22AGL020).",,Annals of Operations Research,,,,44931,2023,44931,44931,,,16803,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Liu, Jiaguo; Xu, Haonan; Chen, Jihong","Liu, Jiaguo (School of Maritime Economics and Management, Dalian Maritime University, 116026, Dalian, China); Xu, Haonan (School of Maritime Economics and Management, Dalian Maritime University, 116026, Dalian, China); Chen, Jihong (College of Management, Shenzhen University, 518073, Shenzhen, China)","Chen, Jihong (Shenzhen University)","Liu, Jiaguo (Dalian Maritime University); Xu, Haonan (Dalian Maritime University); Chen, Jihong (Shenzhen University)",6,6,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10479-022-05132-1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154257664,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

These changes have been influenced by the global drive to reduce the environmental burden associated with the operation of vehicles. Although these trends are primarily focused on the environmental aspects of vehicle operation, the economic aspects inevitably associated with the operation of each vehicle are also changing. This article deals with the calculation of life cycle costs, or the return on investment for vehicles with alternative drives compared to conventional drives. In order to obtain objective outputs, a mathematical model for the calculation of the life cycle costs of passenger vehicles has been developed and applied to these vehicles. The presented mathematical model expresses the acquisition costs and mainly the ownership costs for operation and maintenance. Finally, a comparison of the whole life cycle costs of selected vehicles with different powertrains was made. The following powertrains are compared in this paper, i.e. petrol engine, diesel engine, petrol and CNG engine, mild hybrid engine, plug-in hybrid engine and electric motor. The presented findings and input values for the calculations of the individual cost components reflect the current state in terms of economic demands. Due to the high rate of development and improvement of alternative propulsion modes, especially pure electric propulsion technologies, it can be assumed that the life cycle costs will follow a decreasing trend.","Presented work has been prepared with the support of the Ministry of Defence of the Czech Republic, Partial Project for Institutional Development and Specific Research, Department of Combat and Special Vehicles, University of Defence in Brno.",,Scientific Reports,,,Air Pollutants; Animals; Electricity; Gasoline; Life Cycle Stages; Motor Vehicles; Ownership; Vehicle Emissions,44735,2022,44735,,12,1,10661,All OA; Gold,Article,"Furch, Jan; Koneéçn?´, Vlastimil; Krobot, Zdené?k","Furch, Jan (Department of Combat and Special Vehicles, Faculty of Military Technology, University of Defence, 65, Kounicova 65, 662 10, Brno, Czech Republic); Koneéçn?´, Vlastimil (Department of Combat and Special Vehicles, Faculty of Military Technology, University of Defence, 65, Kounicova 65, 662 10, Brno, Czech Republic); Krobot, Zdené?k (Department of Combat and Special Vehicles, Faculty of Military Technology, University of Defence, 65, Kounicova 65, 662 10, Brno, Czech Republic)","Furch, Jan (University of Defence)","Furch, Jan (University of Defence); Koneéçn?´, Vlastimil (University of Defence); Krobot, Zdené?k (University of Defence)",9,9,0.29,7.14,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-14715-8.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148904878,"33 Built Environment and Design; 35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 40 Engineering",7 Affordable and Clean Energy

In this context, the public sector is mainly recognised as an actor enabling the implementation of a sustainable CE through governmental interventions and policy initiatives. However, there is a lack of studies considering the public sector at an organisational level. CE in organisations includes a wide range of different practices that are important to examine in order to analyse the CE implementation process. Consequently, this study aims to characterise the current state of implementing circular practices and supporting strategies in central public sector organisations. To fulfil this aim, a questionnaire survey was sent to the organisations pertaining to the Portuguese Central Public Administration, as surveys are valuable tools to systematically collect information on various topics. The results demonstrate a relatively low level of implementation. Circular practices such as purchasing remanufactured or used items, using sharing platforms, increasing the efficiency of buildings, adopting green human resources and collaborative initiatives for circularity, and assessing and communicating about CE activities have presented low levels of adoption. At the same time, waste collection for recycling and dematerialisation practices showed good implementation levels. There is, thus, immense potential for further implementation of circularity in central public sector organisations in Portugal. This research contributes to deepening the understanding of the extent to which circular practices are embedded in public sector organisations and identifying the main implementation strengths and weaknesses. This research has the potential to help practitioners and researchers in the transition towards circularity in identifying circular opportunities in their organisations and in building a vision to further implement circularity in public sector organisations.","This research was funded by the European Union&#x27;s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skè?odowska-Curie grant agreement No 765198 and constitutes part of the outcomes of the research project CRESTING (Circular Economy: Sustainability implications and guiding progress).

Using quantitative content analysis, 1024 posts from 48 Israeli farmers' Facebook brand pages were categorized into altruistic messages (ethnocentric, toward farmers, toward the environment, and maintaining public health) and egoistic messages (economic, emotional, functional, and hedonic values). The effectiveness of the message appeals was determined by consumer behavioral engagement (comments, shares and likes) with the posts.

Having information about the possible spread of the pandemic, authorities and people can make better decisions. For example, such analyses help developing better strategies for distributing vaccines and medicines. This paper has modified the original Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered (SIR) model to Susceptible-Immune-Infected-Recovered (SIRM) which includes the Immunity ratio as a parameter to enhance the prediction of the pandemic. SIR is a widely used model to predict the spread of a pandemic. Many types of pandemics imply many variants of the SIR models which make it very difficult to find out the best model that matches the running pandemic. The simulation of this paper used the published data about the spread of the pandemic in order to examine our new SIRM.

Therefore, resilience and adaptation to shocks from pandemics such as COVID-19 are urgently needed. However, despite some coping strategies already in place among SMEs, research on their nature and effectiveness is limited. Thus, it remains unclear how effectively and sustainably documented coping strategies reduce SMEs' vulnerability and increase their resilience to pandemic risk. This article reviews academic literature for evidence of pandemic risk impacts on SMEs, coping strategies in response to these impacts, and the degree to which these strategies reduce SMEs' vulnerability and increase their resilience. According to the literature review, seven essential pandemic risk impacts were identified for SMEs - human movement restrictions, financial constraints, operational challenges, logistics difficulties, delayed business reopening, short-term policy focus and tacit knowledge workers. The study also outlined eleven critical coping strategies, notably structural or physical and behavioural changes. Study analysis reveals that resilience research among SMEs is predominantly conceptual with limited empirical evidence. To conclude, this study urges more adaptation research focused on developing new forms of pandemic risk education for SMEs addressing their complexities.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Therefore, the objective of article is to analyze the requirements and documented information of two management system standards: environmental management systems (EMS), according to ISO 14001, and occupational health and safety management systems (OH&S), according to ISO 45001. A combination of content analysis and clustering methods was used to conduct the research. Visualization of the interrelationships between the requirements of the standards was done using TouchGraph Navigator. The outputs of the analysis can serve managers in the integrated implementation of these management systems as well as auditors during the review and check process when formulating recommendations for the improvement of management systems. Integrated implementation comes with multiple benefits, including reduced bureaucracy and management costs, a simplified certification process, improved internal management, and facilitation of continuous improvement.","This paper was written with the support of the Cultural and Educational Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Slovak Republic as a part of project No. KEGA 031STU-4/2020 É??Network visualization of common and specific elements and documented information of integrated management systems with respect to relevant ISO standardsÉ?ù.","This research was funded by the Cultural and Educational Grant Agency of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of the Slovak Republic as a part of project No. KEGA 031STU-4/2020 É??Network visualization of common and specific elements and documented information of integrated management systems with respect to relevant ISO standardsÉ?ù.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Paul B.

However, implementing I4.0 remains a significant challenge for many organizations, mainly due to the absence of a systematic and comprehensive framework. The risk assessment study is key to the flawless execution of any project is a proven fact. This paper aims to develop a KPIs-based sustainable integrated model to assess and evaluate risks associated with the I4.0 implementation. This research paper has developed the I4.0 risks evaluation model through fifteen expert interventions and an extensive systematic literature review. This research, based on sixteen KPIs evaluates six risks impacting the organizationÉ??s decision to adopt I4.0. Initially, the Fuzzy Decision-Making Trial and Evaluation Laboratory method is used to map the causal relationship among the KPIs. Further, the additive ratio assessment with interval triangular fuzzy numbers method is used to rank the risks. The study revealed that information technology infrastructure and prediction capabilities are the most crucial prominence and receiver KPIs. Simultaneously, technological and social risks are found to be highly significant in the I4.0 implementation decision-making process. The developed model meticulously supports the manufacturerÉ??s, policymaker, and researchersÉ?? viewpoint toward I4.0 implementation in the present and post COVID-19 pandemic phases in manufacturing companies. The comprehensive yet simple model developed in this study contributes to the larger ambit of new knowledge and extant literature. The integrated model is exceptionally based on the most prominent risks and a wider range of KPIs that are further analyzed by aptly fitting two fuzzy MCDM techniques, which makes the study special as it perfectly takes care of the uncertainties and vagueness in the decision-making process.

A cyber-competence map describing the capacity and trends of the CS workforce is an essential element of the workforce development strategy. Large enterprises tend to have narrowly specialised employees with clearly identifiable roles. Still, most enterprises in small countries are SMEs. Therefore, the tasks and responsibilities of many CS-related specialists overlap the functions of several roles.

The work applies a combined qualitative and quantitative methodological approach to collect data using questionnaires and expert interviews in the CS field organisations. The study includes a representative public survey, a large-scale survey of company executives, an exploratory CS expert survey, and a comprehensive job posting analysis. Finally, a national CS competence map is presented and verified using two qualitative semi-structured interviews with field professionals. Even though the map reflects a status of a small nation state, it is activity-based and might be applicable in any country.

The identification of symbiotic relationships contributes to the more sustainable development of industrial activities. However, businesses operating in industrial parks are diversified by sector. In order to establish a sustainable symbiosis network in industrial parks, the symbiotic relations of each sector in industrial parks should be evaluated separately. Thus, the installation process of the symbiosis network will be easier and more sustainable. In this context, this study aims to prioritize the sector in which a symbiosis network will be established by presenting an innovative approach for the evaluation of symbiosis potentials. For this purpose, criteria for the implementation process affecting the establishment of the symbiosis network were determined. Multi-criteria decision-making methods were used to solve the problem. Considering the uncertainties in the process, fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methods were used. As a result, a decision-making model has been proposed to determine the priority sector in order to establish a symbiosis network in industrial parks. According to the results obtained with the multi-criteria decision-making methods, the number of enterprises that will evaluate the waste, that is, the number of customers with waste, has been determined as the criterion with the highest level of importance. While evaluating the alternatives, the casting sector was chosen as a priority. This sector is followed by the petro and chemical sector as the second alternative.",,EY is supported by the Higher Education Institution (CoHE) within the scope of 100/2000 PhD scholarship.,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,Symbiosis; Industry; Uncertainty; Sustainable Development; Commerce; Fuzzy Logic,45079,2023,45079,2023-07,30,31,77875-77889,Closed,Article,"YazéÒcéÒ, Emre; Alakaè?, HacéÒ Mehmet; Eren, Tamer","YazéÒcéÒ, Emre (Faculty of Engineering, Department of Industrial Engineering, KéÒréÒkkale University, Ankara Yolu 7.

Vaccines are the strongest evidence-based defense against the spread of the disease. The release of COVID-19 vaccines to the general public created policy challenges associated with how to best allocate vaccines among different sub-regions. In the United States, after vaccines became widely available for all eligible adults, policymakers faced objectives such as (i) achieving an equitable allocation to reduce populations' travel times to get vaccinated and (ii) effectively allocating vaccine doses to minimize waste and unmet need. This problem was further exacerbated by the underlying factors of population vaccine hesitancy and sub-regions' varying capacity levels to administer vaccines to eligible and willing populations. Although simple to implement, commonly used pro rata policies do not capture the complexities of this problem. We propose two alternatives to simple pro rata policies. The first alternative is based on a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Model that minimizes the maximum travel duration of patients and aims to achieve an equitable and effective allocation of vaccines to sub-regions while considering capacity and vaccine hesitancy. A second alternative is a heuristic approach that may be more palatable for policymakers who (i) are not familiar with mathematical modeling, (ii) are reluctant to use black-box models, and (iii) prefer algorithms that are easy to understand and implement. We demonstrate the results of our model through a case study based on real data from the state of Alabama and show that substantial improvements in travel time-based equity are achievable through capacity improvements in a small subset of counties. We perform additional computational experiments that compare the proposed methods in terms of several metrics and demonstrate the promising performance of our model and proposed heuristic. We find that while our mathematical model can achieve equitable and effective vaccine allocation, the proposed heuristic performs better if the goal is to minimize average travel duration. Finally, we explore two model extensions that aim to (i) lower vaccine hesitancy by allocating vaccines, and (ii) prioritize vaccine access for certain high-risk sub-populations.",Declaration of Competing Interest Authors declare that they have no conflict of interest.,,Omega,,,,45066,2023,45066,2023-10,120,,102898,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Sengul Orgut, Irem; Freeman, Nickolas; Lewis, Dwight; Parton, Jason","Sengul Orgut, Irem (Department of Information Systems, Statistics, and Management Science, The University of Alabama, 361 Stadium Dr, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487, United States.); Freeman, Nickolas (Department of Information Systems, Statistics, and Management Science, The University of Alabama, 361 Stadium Dr, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487, United States.); Lewis, Dwight (Department of Management, The University of Alabama, 361 Stadium Dr, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487, United States.); Parton, Jason (Department of Information Systems, Statistics, and Management Science, The University of Alabama, 361 Stadium Dr, Tuscaloosa, AL 35487, United States.)","Sengul Orgut, Irem (University of Alabama)","Sengul Orgut, Irem (University of Alabama); Freeman, Nickolas (University of Alabama); Lewis, Dwight (University of Alabama); Parton, Jason (University of Alabama)",5,5,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.omega.2023.102898,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1158225400,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",3 Good Health and Well Being

Current REM production from the primary mineral resources in the supply chain versus industrial demand is at a bottleneck. Alternatively, REM-bearing anthropogenic wastes are pertinent and potent to addressing the critical supply chain bottleneck. Although secondary REM resources are prudent to address the critical supply chain bottleneck, the absence of effective and efficient technologies to recover these REMs from anthropogenic waste imposes challenges and provides opportunities. Hence, this review analyses and discusses the significance of anthropogenic wastes for REM recovery, the status of recycling technologies for sustainable valorization of REMs, challenges, and opportunities. The current review covers the potential quantitative REM wealth locked in various anthropogenic waste like (i) spent rare earth permanent magnets, (ii) spent batteries, (iii) spent tri-band REM phosphors, (iv) bauxite industry residue red mud, (v) blast furnace slag and (v) coal mines, and coal byproducts and status of valorization technologies for circularizing the REMs. In industrial waste like red mud, steelmaking slag, blast furnace slag, and coal fly ash typically 109,000, 2000, 39,000, and 354,000 tons of REM get scrapped, respectively, in a conservative estimation. In the years 2020 and 2021, respectively, 240,000 and 280,000 tons of REM were produced by mine production in contrast to 504,000 tons of REM that were scrapped with REM-bearing industrial waste. This review revealed that total REM currently getting scrapped with anthropogenic waste versus projected REM demand for the years 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025 could be standing at 2.66, 2.51, 2.37, and 2.23, respectively. Our investigation revealed that efficient recovery of REMs from anthropogenic waste is significant and promising but associated with challenges like lack of industrial-scale valorization process, lack of a clear strategy, road map, policy, effort, funding, and diversified research.","The authors declare that no funds, grants, or other support were received during the preparation of this manuscript.","The authors declare that no funds, grants, or other support were received during the preparation of this manuscript.",Reviews in Environmental Science and Bio/Technology,,,,44976,2023,44976,2023-03,22,1,133-173,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Swain, Basudev","Swain, Basudev (Institute for Advanced Engineering (IAE), Materials Science and Chemical Engineering Center, 449-863, Yongin-Si, Republic of Korea)","Swain, Basudev (Institute for Advanced Engineering)","Swain, Basudev (Institute for Advanced Engineering)",7,7,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11157-023-09647-2.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155539586,"34 Chemical Sciences; 35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 40 Engineering",12 Responsible Consumption and Production

The results showed that the income of retailers and suppliers changes under different perceptions of fraudulent income. That is, the value of cleaner production fraudulent income perception factor will affect the enterpriseÉ??s choice of differentiation strategy. When the enterpriseÉ??s sense of social responsibility is weak, it is more likely to choose cleaner production fraud. Conversely, under the constraints of high social responsibility, it more likely avoids production fraud. Regarding government supervision, the income of suppliers and retailers changes under different government penalties. Furthermore, a reasonable punishment for cleaner production fraud can reduce such violations. However, after the punishment reaches a level, the efficiency of supervision begins to decline. In views of that, improving enterprise social responsibility through institutional reform is a more effective way to reduce cleaner production fraud.

The construction of supplier transaction is one of the strategic choices of many firms. However, the impact of business strategies on the persistence of earnings remains to be further investigated. The innovation of this paper lies in interpreting the impact of supplier transaction on earnings persistence from the perspective of characteristics of the top management team (TMT). We consider Chinese listed manufacturing firms from 2012 to 2019 to examine the relationship between the supplier transaction and the persistence of earnings. Statistical results show that supplier transaction characteristics of the TMT have a significant moderating effect on the relationship between the supplier transaction and the persistence of earnings.

The safety and security of international shipping of crucial elements such as oil has always been important aspect in the landscape of piracy. The implications of piracy attacks are linked with loss of cargo or personnel, economic and environmental catastrophe. Despite maritime piracy being a major concern to international trade, no comprehensive study considers the causing factors and spatio-temporal patterns that influence the choice of attack areas. Thus, this research expands our understanding on the areas where piracy mainly occurs, and its underlying causes. To achieve these objectives, AHP and spatio-temporal analysis applied by using data from the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. The results indicate that territorial waters are preferable areas; thus, pirates prefer to attack the ships close to the coastline fewer times near ports, and rarely in international waters. This is in line with the spatio-temporal analysis results that show that pirates except for the Arabian sea prefer to hit close to the coastline of countries that face political instability, lack of properly functioning government and extreme poverty. Moreover, pirates in certain areas are influenced by the activity and the information from other pirates, which can be used as tool from the authorities e.g., derive information from pirates that have been arrested. Overall, this study contributes on the literature of maritime piracy, and it could be used to enhance security and build tailored defense strategies in perilous water areas.",,No funding was received to assist with the preparation of this manuscript.,Annals of Operations Research,,,,45044,2023,45044,2024-04,335,2,861-883,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Tsioufis, Marios; Fytopoulos, Antonios; Kalaitzi, Dimitra; Alexopoulos, Thomas A.","Tsioufis, Marios (Department of Economics, School of Economics and Technology, University ofPeloponnese, Tripolis Campus, Tripoli, Greece); Fytopoulos, Antonios (Department of Chemical Engineering, KU Leuven, Celestijnenlaan 200F, 3001, Leuven, Belgium; School of Chemical Engineering, NTUA, Athens, Greece); Kalaitzi, Dimitra (Aston University Engineering Systems and Management: Aston University School of Engineering and Technology, Birmingham, West Midlands, United Kingdom); Alexopoulos, Thomas A.

Nevertheless, there are still many divisive changes that need to be made in order to implement UAVs into a countryÉ??s humanitarian sector successfully. Hence, this paper aims to analyze the various barriers hindering the implementation of UAVs in humanitarian logistics for both developed and developing nations. To accomplish this, the study is presented in three steps. First, previous literature and opinions from experts are analyzed to illuminate particular factors that hinder UAV implementation. Next, we propose an interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy set (IVIFS) based graph theory and matrix approach (GTMA) to calculate a drone implementation hindrance index (DIHI). The GTMA method used in this paper utilizes the PERMAN algorithm to calculate the permanent function. Finally, the DIHI values are plotted and analyzed to compare the readiness of drone implementation between developed and developing economies. A sensitivity analysis is then performed to provide validity to the results obtained. The study has revealed that both types of countries must first improve their inadequate government regulations regarding humanitarian UAVs. Developing countries must also focus on enhancing the technological awareness of their population. The results of this study can be used by policymakers and practitioners to smoothly implement UAVs in their country's humanitarian sector. The general index defined in this paper can also be calculated for specific countries using the steps mentioned in the manuscript.",The authors would like to express their gratitude towards the academic and industry experts for their valuable support in evaluating the proposed framework.

While such technological advancements provide numerous advantages and opportunities, they are known to thread organizations with new challenges such as cyberattacks. This is particularly important for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) that are deemed to be the least mature and highly vulnerable to cybersecurity risks. Thus, this research is set to assess the cyber risks in online retailing SMEs (e-tailing SMEs). Therefore, this article employs a sample of 124 small e-tailers in the United Kingdom and takes advantage of a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) method. Indeed, we identified a total number of 28 identified cyber-oriented risks in five exhaustive themes of ""security,"" ""dependency,"" ""employee,"" ""strategic,"" and ""legal"" risks. Subsequently, an integrated approach using step-wise weight assessment ratio analysis (SWARA) and best-worst method (BWM) has been employed to develop a pathway of risk assessment. As such, the current study outlines a novel approach toward cybersecurity risk management for e-tailing SMEs and discusses its effectiveness and contributions to the cyber risk management literature.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors would like to thank the editors and anonymous reviewers for their insightful comments that significantly improved the manuscript.

Although scholars have primarily attributed this problem to poor attitudes and behaviour toward the consumption of locally produced rice, limited attention has been paid to behavioural change approaches. Thus, from the perspective of the theory of planned behaviour, the study sought to understand the factors that influence consumersÉ?? intention to consume locally produced rice and to suggest solutions from a social marketing perspective to elicit voluntary changes in behaviour toward the consumption of local rice. Quantitative and qualitative data were collected from 375 to 40 participants, respectively. Qualitative data were analysed thematically, while quantitative data were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling. The results showed a strong positive and significant relationship between attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioural control, and intention to consume locally produced rice. The results showed a weak significant negative relationship between intention and actual consumption of local rice, suggesting a high intention-behaviour gap. However, the qualitative results identified six critical factors that prevented people from consuming local rice though having the intention. These factors include cooking difficulty, suitability for few local dishes, lack of taste and aroma, foreign materials, poor packaging and standard specification, and unavailability. Thus, interventions addressing these barriers will significantly increase the consumption of local rice in Ghana. The study contributes to literature by using the mixed method approach and the theory of planned behaviour to predict factors that could improve local rice consumption in a developing country context. We also addressed how the 4Ps of social marketing could be used to address the identified barriers.",,There is no funding for this study.,International Review on Public and Nonprofit Marketing,,,,45034,2023,45034,2024-03,21,1,177-196,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Coffie, Isaac Sewornu; Tweneboah-Koduah, Ernest Yaw; Ocloo, Elikem Chosniel; Nkukpornu, Atsu; Kastner, Adelaide Naa Amerley","Coffie, Isaac Sewornu (Department of Marketing, Accra Technical University, Accra, Ghana); Tweneboah-Koduah, Ernest Yaw (Department of Marketing and Entrepreneurship, University of Ghana Business School, Accra, Ghana); Ocloo, Elikem Chosniel (Department of Marketing, Accra Technical University, Accra, Ghana); Nkukpornu, Atsu (Department of Innovation, Cape Coast Technical University, Cape Coast, Ghana); Kastner, Adelaide Naa Amerley (Central University, Accra, Ghana)","Coffie, Isaac Sewornu (Accra Technical University)","Coffie, Isaac Sewornu (Accra Technical University); Tweneboah-Koduah, Ernest Yaw (University of Ghana); Ocloo, Elikem Chosniel (Accra Technical University); Nkukpornu, Atsu (Cape Coast Technical University); Kastner, Adelaide Naa Amerley (Central University)",1,1,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12208-023-00370-w.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157335453,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3506 Marketing",

Actions taken in the sole interests of patients, as required by the Hippocratic oath, can have broadly inconvenient economic implications for the State. (""Average"" benefits for a population can impose individual inconveniences for the vulnerable.). Understandably these decisions are not normally made explicitly and transparently by governments. This leads to seemingly illogical and inhumane strategies which are not understood and hence mistrusted and often ignored by the public. Vaccination sentiments on social media are often an unwanted symptom of this dilemma. This article outlines and discusses a number of examples of such situations with a focus on ethical aspects. It concludes that each case must be considered individually as to the issues that need to be weighed in these difficult decisions; and that there are no clear and universally acceptable ethical solutions. What can be learned from the COVID-19 crisis is that short term utilitarianism has consequences that in the eyes of the population are unacceptable. This lesson seems equally valid for cost benefit evaluations regarding other risks, such as from hazardous industries, flood defenses, and air transport.

However, interdisciplinary research on blockchain technology and carbon trading companies is currently rare. Based on this, this paper takes the integration of blockchain technology and carbon trading companies as the background and draws on relevant theories such as blockchain technology, carbon trading mechanisms, and major technological changes to study the influencing factors of carbon trading companies applying blockchain technology by combining theoretical deduction with an empirical test. The results show that (1) the number of companies in ChinaÉ??s eight carbon trading pilots shows an obvious regional imbalance. Among them, more companies participated in the carbon trading pilot in Shenzhen and Beijing while less in Tianjin and Hubei. Meanwhile, the participating companies in the eight carbon trading pilots are mainly concentrated in eight industries, including electric power, petrochemical, chemical, building materials, iron and steel, nonferrous metals, papermaking, and domestic civil aviation. (2) The willingness of carbon pilot companies to use blockchain technology is stronger; the time for carbon pilot companies to learn and master blockchain technology is shorter, otherwise, the longer. Therefore, priority can be given to applying blockchain technology in carbon pilot industries with strong use willingness. (3) If more companies participate in carbon trading, the easier it is for companies to learn to use blockchain technology in the early stage.

As the tourism and hospitality industry is a labor-intensive industry, the impact of COVID-19 pandemic-induced economic downturn is expected to be particularly severe here. To estimate this impact, I use a large, representative panel survey from India, and employ difference-in-differences method in this study. The estimated decline in total income ranges between 3.12 and 6.39%, and wage fall ranges between 3.21 and 5.98%, for the sample with individuals who are still earning a non-zero income from this industry. Once I include the individuals who have completely lost their livelihood (zero income) due to COVID-19 pandemic in the sample, impact on income is estimated to be a fall of 58.69% and impact on wage is estimated to be a decline of 58.59%.

The results suggest that female-led firms engage more with normative CSR, while male leadership prompts a more instrumental approach. Overall, B2B companies engage more in instrumental CSR, while there are no significant differences between B2B and B2C firms in normative CSR. Interestingly, the results indicate that female-led firms engage more in CSR practices (normative and instrumental) in the B2B sector compared to B2C. Male-led firms, by contrast, tend to do so more in instrumental CSR in the B2C sector, thus operating more instrumentally when the outlook appears more promising. The results challenge existing theories whereby female-led firms may engage more in CSR in the B2C sector as opposed to B2B. The results support theories proposing that female-led firms adopt more of a stewardship theory approach in the B2B sector, building relationships and social capital through activities such as CSR. The findings extend the state-of-the-art on how gender may influence CSR practices in both type (normative or instrumental) and circumstance (B2B or B2C).","The authors would like to thank the reviewers for their time and dedication for providing valuable feedback, which has allowed us to improve the manuscript.

Particularly for islands, there is also an important social dimension of this sector, since island communities strongly rely on it for a connection with the mainland and the transportation of goods and passengers. Furthermore, islands are exceptionally vulnerable to climate change, as the rising sea level and extreme events are expected to induce severe impacts. Such hazards are anticipated to also affect the operations of the maritime transport sector by affecting either the port infrastructure or ships en route. The present study is an effort to better comprehend and assess the future risk of maritime transport disruption in six European islands and archipelagos, and it aims at supporting regional to local policy and decision-making. We employ state-of-the-art regional climate datasets and the widely used impact chain approach to identify the different components that might drive such risks. Larger islands (e.g., Corsica, Cyprus and Crete) are found to be more resilient to the impacts of climate change on maritime operations. Our findings also highlight the importance of adopting a low-emission pathway, since this will keep the risk of maritime transport disruption similar to present levels or even slightly decreased for some islands because of an enhanced adaptation capacity and advantageous demographic changes.","This work has received funding from the European UnionÉ??s H2020 Research and Innovation Programme under grant agreement no. 776661 (SOCLIMPACT project).

Concerns regarding the effects of such fast expansion on the environment have been expressed as a result of this increase, however. Prioritizing environmental sustainability is now more crucial than ever in this situation. This research develops a theoretical model to assess the relative advantages Big Data have on R&D via É??substitution effectsÉ?ù and É??complementary effects,É?ù and further leads to directed technological change and its influence on environmental quality. We examine various effects on environmental quality while taking into account and without taking into account the extensive data application to understand the function of Big Data better. Big Data and environmental sustainability may be used to provide major commercial advantages, such as cost savings, higher productivity, and enhanced reputation. Big Data in environmental monitoring may be used to better detect and solve sustainability challenges including resource depletion, waste management, and air and water pollution. Big Data analytics may facilitate better forecasting and decision-making, enabling businesses and industries to develop more sustainable practices and strategies. Big Data management needs a dedication to sustainability principles and practices, as well as a thorough awareness of the environmental impact of the company or sector. In the era of Big Data, cooperation between enterprises, industries, governments, and other stakeholders is crucial for advancing environmental sustainability.

The study adopts a qualitative research method to construct a model of factors influencing the generation of consumer word-of-mouth (IWOM) in the online consumption context, taking the real consumer word-of-mouth of Jingdong's own flagship shop of prepared dishes as the object of the study. The model states that the objective factors that promote the generation of word of mouth include specific consumption context (emotionality, initiality, scarcity, convenience and process) and specific product attributes (richness, safety, accessibility and emotionality). Meanwhile subjective factors design consumer satisfaction with the product (satisfaction with a single attribute and satisfaction with the brand as a whole) and emotions (positive self-conscious emotions, high arousal positive emotions and medium arousal positive emotions). Objective factors may contribute directly to the generation of word-of-mouth, or they may further contribute to word-of-mouth generation through subjective consumer factors. In addition, IWOM is often generated not by a single factor, but by a combination of factors.",,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Charles Odilichukwu R.

Due to the constrained audit resources, the planning process primarily involves the analysis and evaluation of complex factors for selecting auditable units that maximize the full potential of internal audit. Previous research on internal audit planning only focused on the goal of risk minimization and applied ranking methods to prioritize alternatives. In order to enable internal audit activities to add more value to the organization, the integrated risk-based internal audit planning is proposed to assist audit department in achieving multiple objectives in addition to risk management. Meanwhile, a multi-stage framework is proposed to support the development of such value-added internal audit plan. The new framework integrates the risk assessment of auditable units with the selection of audit activities and resource allocation through a combined analytic hierarchy process (AHP), fuzzy comprehensive evaluation (FCE) and weighted multi-choice goal programming (WMCGP) approach. The model considers both qualitative and quantitative decision criteria. A real-life case study of the development of an integrated risk-based annual audit plan is presented, and sensitivity analysis is performed to illustrate the validity of the proposed approach. The results indicate that the proposed framework is a useful tool for internal audit planning and the implications of the study can be extended to various selection and allocation problems.","This work is an outcome of the doctoral thesis of the first author, undertaken at the University Institute of Lisbon (ISCTE-IUL), Portugal, and the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), P.

Consequently, ubiquitous internal and external communication (controls, commands, and data) within all CAV-related nodes is inevitably the gatekeeper for the smooth operation. Therefore, it is a primary vulnerable area for cyber-attacks that entails stringent and efficient measures in the form of ""cybersecurity"". There is a lack of systematic and comprehensive review of the literature on cyber-attacks on the CAVs, respective mitigation strategies, anticipated readiness, and research directions for the future. This study aims to analyse, synthesise, and interpret critical areas for the roll-out and progression of CAVs in combating cyber-attacks. Specifically, we described in a structured way a holistic view of potentially critical avenues, which lies at the heart of CAV cybersecurity research. We synthesise their scope with a particular focus on ensuring effective CAVs deployment and reducing the probability of cyber-attack failures. We present the CAVs communication framework in an integrated form, i.e., from In-Vehicle (IV) communication to Vehicle-to-Vehicle (V2X) communication with a visual flowchart to provide a transparent picture of all the interfaces for potential cyber-attacks. The vulnerability of CAVs by proximity (or physical) access to cyber-attacks is outlined with future recommendations. There is a detailed description of why the orthodox cybersecurity approaches in Cyber-Physical System (CPS) are not adequate to counter cyber-attacks on the CAVs. Further, we synthesised a table with consolidated details of the cyber-attacks on the CAVs, the respective CAV communication system, its impact, and the corresponding mitigation strategies. It is believed that the literature discussed, and the findings reached in this paper are of great value to CAV researchers, technology developers, and decision-makers in shaping and developing a robust CAV-cybersecurity framework.","The authors would also like to acknowledge the Australian Government, Department of Industry, Innovation and Science for the financial support received for this study through the Automotive Engineering Graduate Program (GRANT NO: AEGP000050).

A questionnaire survey was carried out to understand the impact of COVID-19 on consumers' affordability, lifestyle, and health awareness and how these effects influenced their buying behaviour. A total of 425 usable responses were analysed using the structural equation modelling considering Consumers' socio-economic background as exogenous variables and Consumers' changing way of life and Adaptation in consumers' buying behaviour as endogenous variables. The study reveals that COVID-19 has affected the consumers in the unorganised sectors more than others and induced an increase in the demand for affordable substitutes for daily necessities. The demand for wellness and entertainment products is found to depend upon the occupation and family earning status of consumers which is jointly mediated by affordability and lifestyle changes. Further, the findings show that the demand for health and hygiene products depends on the current employment status and family earning status of consumers which is jointly mediated by affordability and awareness towards health and hygiene. The model developed in the present study allows the decision-makers to identify which segments of the population with certain socio-economic backgrounds could be targeted for wellness products and which ones could be targeted for health and hygiene products.

It causes evident damage on the epigeal parts of plant (leaves and branches) and, in particular, on the fruits, causing their fall and/or deterioration, making them unsuitable for sale. EPPO has signaled its presence in many Asian countries and in the Middle East, in South and Central America and in some regions of the African continent, but not yet in Europe. There are several possible ways of introducing this pathogen into the Mediterranean Basin and, among these, there is the trade of plant material for propagation and planting and the flow of tourism between the risk areas and the Mediterranean countries. This research demonstrates how the risk of invasion through ornamental Rutaceae is evident and identifies - in a participatory way through the involvement of stakeholders - some possible tools of phytosanitary protection.

The papers in this issue examine how different countries implement industrial policy for sustainable development from a variety of perspectives. A successful transition to sustainable development seems to require not only the mix of carrots and sticks but also a right mix of creation versus destruction, as in the case of the creation of renewable businesses and the destruction of fossil-fuel businesses. Furthermore, because institutional diversity and the risk of capture can result in very distinct economic, social, and environmental effects, consideration of heterogeneity at the country and sector levels and coordination of vested interests are essential ingredients for sustainable industrial policies, as shown by the case of industrial policy in France and the two industry cases in India. By contrast, the Amazon Fund case is indicative of the three success elements: multi-stakeholder governance, pay-for-performance funding, and non-reimbursable project financing. These three elements can be summarized as local ownership and accountable governance, provided with both carrots and sticks. The problematic case of urban development driven by the oil industry in Ghana can be criticized in terms of the lack of local ownership of the oil industry, which has led to all rents being monopolized by the absentee class. By comparison, the mixed success of cases of industrial symbiosis in Uganda is attributed to the lack of effective carrots. In sum, industrial policy for sustainable development requires handling well all three types of failure, namely, market, system, and capability failures, because it necessitates building capabilities of involved actors and coordinating actions of agents, in addition to providing optimal incentives to reflect externalities of global public goods. Overall, the shifting focus of industrial policy is consistent with the shift of the role of the state, from developmental to entrepreneurial, and finally to environmental state.","The authors of this paper, who are also the guest editors of this special issue, wish to acknowledge all the anonymous referees for their valuable contributions and comments on earlier versions of the papers in this special issue.

Aggregating global logistics data to a manageable level where interruptions and disruptions can be anticipated or resolved is high on the wish list of global logistics managers and decision makers. Asset tracking and condition visibility in global supply chains is also difficult because few standards or metrics have been assessed in a supply chain, particularly when new technology is introduced, such as unmanned aerial systems in global supply chains. In this paper, we describe the integration of an unmanned aerial system in a global logistics system, and the metrics used to assess the integrated system.

The need to include compound considerations is known, but lack of guidance is prohibiting practitioners from including these considerations. This article makes a step toward practitioner guidance by providing examples where consideration of compound drivers, hazards, and impacts may affect different application domains within disaster risk management. We discern five DRR categories and provide illustrative examples of studies that highlight the role of ""compound thinking"" in early warning, emergency response, infrastructure management, long-term planning, and capacity building. We conclude with a number of common elements that may contribute to the development of practical guidelines to develop appropriate applications for risk management.","This article is based upon work from COST Action DAMOCLES, CA17109, supported by COST (European Cooperation in Science and Technology).

The case of medical supplies,"The COVID-19 pandemic has caused a dramatic shortage in the medical supplies needed to treat the virus due to a massive surge in demand as the disease circled the globe during the first half of 2020. Prior to the crisis, there was an interdependence of trade and production for medical supplies, with advanced industrial countries like the United States and Germany specializing in the relatively high-tech medical devices sector, while low-cost production hubs such as China and Malaysia were leading producers of less technologically sophisticated personal protective equipment (PPE) products such as face masks, surgical gloves, and medical gowns. After the COVID-19 outbreak, global shortages of PPE products emerged as many affected countries imposed export controls and sought ways to boost domestic output. A case study of the face mask value chain in the United States shows misalignments between the priorities of U.S. federal government officials and the strategies of leading U.S. multinational producers of face masks, which resulted in exceptionally costly policy delays in terms of health outcomes. On balance, the U.S. shortage of N95 respirators during the COVID-19 pandemic is more a policy failure than a market failure.

This is potentially a serious problem for multinational companies, since ChinaÉ??s rise could lead to more USÉ??China trade conflict and disruption of supply chains, threatening new and ongoing foreign direct investment, and drawing other countries into the jostling for power. However, we argue that globalization is not necessarily endangered by ChinaÉ??s emergence as a comparable power to the US. The US and China both have vested interests in maintaining the open economic order, and these two countries are each providing the global public goods that incentivize economic openness among other countries of the world. In this paper, we develop a theory corresponding to this argument and provide evidence that globalization has not declined even as the global distribution of power has shifted. While global integration is likely to persist, disruptive skirmishes between the US and China will occur with some regularity. Therefore, we suggest that international company strategies today should focus more on risk management related to policy shifts stemming from ChinaÉ??s rise and less on achieving least-cost global supply chains. We present a risk management framework for this purpose.","We would like to thank Mark Casson and Rob Spich, as well as the editors of MIR, for their very helpful comments on this paper.",,Management International Review,,,,44258,2021,44258,2021-03,61,1,45317,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Grosse, Robert; Gamso, Jonas; Nelson, Roy C.","Grosse, Robert (Thunderbird School of Global Management, Arizona State University, Phoenix, AZ, USA); Gamso, Jonas (Thunderbird School of Global Management, Arizona State University, Phoenix, AZ, USA); Nelson, Roy C.

This paper aims to construct a model that integrates that technology acceptance model (TAM) and functionality-expressiveness-aesthetics (FEA) model to explore the key factors influencing consumers' smart clothing purchase intentions (PIs). Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to analyze the data, complemented by fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The PLS-SEM results identified that the characteristics of functionality (FUN), expressiveness (EXP), and aesthetics (AES) positively and significantly affect perceived ease of use (PEOU), and only EXP affects perceived usefulness (PU). PU and PEOU positively impact consumers' attitudes (ATTs). Subsequently, PU and consumers' ATTs positively influence PIs. fsQCA revealed the nonlinear and complex interaction effects of the factors influencing consumers' smart clothing purchase behaviors and uncovered five necessary and six sufficient conditions for consumers' PIs. This paper furthers theoretical understanding by integrating the FEA model into the TAM. Additionally, on a practical level, it provides significant insights into consumers' intentions to purchase smart clothing. These findings serve as valuable tools for corporations and designers in strategizing the design and promotion of smart clothing. The results validate theoretical conceptions about smart clothing PIs and provide useful insights and marketing suggestions for smart clothing implementation and development. Moreover, this study is the first to explain smart clothing PIs using symmetric (PLS-SEM) and asymmetric (fsQCA) methods.",,,PLOS ONE,,Mohammed A.

However, there is no well-grounded and systematic measure to gauge the intensity of COVID-related disclosure and its plausible impact. Therefore, this study develops and validates various COVID-related disclosure measures. More specifically, using a sample of publicly listed U.S. firms and applying natural language processing (NLP) on 10-K reports, we have developed two types of COVID dictionaries (or COVID-related disclosure measurement tools): (a) overall COVID dictionary (count of all COVID-related words/phrases) and (b) contextual COVID-dictionary (count of COVID related words/phrases preceded or followed by positive, negative tones, or financial constraints words). Subsequently, we have validated both types of COVID dictionaries by investigating their association with corporate liquidity events (e.g., dividend payment, dividend change). We confirm that the overall COVID dictionary effectively predicts a firm's liquidity event. We find similar results for contextual COVID dictionaries with a negative spin (i.e., COVID disclosures with a negative tone or an indication of financial constraints). Our results further show that better-governed firms (e.g., greater board independence, and more female directors) tend to have more COVID-related disclosures, despite the fact that more COVID-related disclosures suppress a firm's market-based stock performance (e.g. Tobin's Q). Our results suggest that better-governed firms prefer greater transparency, even if it may hurt their market performance in the short run.",,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Rana Muhammad Ammar Zahid,Female; Humans; Disclosure; COVID-19; Organizations,45007,2023,45007,,18,3,e0283138,All OA; Gold,Article,"Dutta, Shantanu; Kumar, Ashok; Pant, Pushpesh; Walsh, Caolan; Dutta, Moumita","Dutta, Shantanu (Telfer School of Management, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada); Kumar, Ashok (Telfer School of Management, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada); Pant, Pushpesh (Operations Department, IMT Hyderabad, Shamshabad, Telangana, India); Walsh, Caolan (Department of Surgery, Faculty of Medicine, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada); Dutta, Moumita (Faculty of Science, University of Ottawa, Ottawa, Canada)","Dutta, Shantanu (University of Ottawa)","Dutta, Shantanu (University of Ottawa); Kumar, Ashok (University of Ottawa); Pant, Pushpesh (Operations Department, IMT Hyderabad, Shamshabad, Telangana, India); Walsh, Caolan (University of Ottawa); Dutta, Moumita (University of Ottawa)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0283138&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156401246,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3501 Accounting, Auditing and Accountability; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

Since the beginning of 2020, the pandemic has contributed significantly to the global recession. In addition to the health damages of the pandemic, the economic impacts are also severe. The consequences of such effects have pushed global supply chains toward their breaking point. Industries have faced multiple obstacles, threatening the fragile flow of raw materials, spare parts, and consumer goods. Previous studies showed that supply chain barriers have multi-faceted impacts on industries and supply chains, which demand appropriate measures. In this regard, seven major barriers that directly impact industries have been identified to determine which industry is most affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. This paper utilized a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) approach under a neutrosophic environment using trapezoidal neutrosophic numbers to rank those barriers. The Analytical Network Process (ANP) quantifies the effects and considers the interrelationships between the determined barriers (criteria) involved in decision-making. Subsequently, the Measurement Alternatives and Ranking according to the COmpromise Solution (MARCOS) method was adopted to rank six industries according to the impact of those barriers. Results show that the lack of inventory is the largest barrier to influencing industries, followed by the lack of manpower. Sensitivity analysis is performed to detect the change in the rank of industries according to the change in the relative importance of the barriers.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This research has no funding source.

To cope with erratic demands, organizations have to maintain excessive inventory levels, sometimes taking up to one-third of an organization's annual budget. The two most pressing concerns to handle in inventory management are: how much to order and when to order. Therefore, an organization ought to make the correct and timely decisions based on precise demand information to avoid excessive inventory accumulation resulting in enhanced competitive advantage. Owing to the significance of inventory control and analysis, this paper reports on developing and successfully implementing a hybrid framework for optimum level inventory forecasting in Technical Services Organizations. The proposed framework is based on a case study of one of Pakistan's leading Technical Services Organization. The paper presents a statistical analysis of historical data and a comprehensive fault trend analysis. Both these analyses set a solid foundation for the formulation of a comparative analysis matrix based upon price and quantity based analysis of inventory. Finally, a decision criterion (Forecasting Model) is proposed using three primary forecasting techniques with minimum error calculations. The study's finding shows a forecast error of 142.5 million rupees in the last five years, resulting in the accumulation of more than 25 thousand excessive inventory stock. Application of price and quantity based analysis identifies that 65% of the annual budget is significantly dependent upon only 9% (in terms of quantity) of ""High Price and Small Quantity"" Items (HS). These HS items are forecasted through three different forecasting methods, i.e., Weighted Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, and Trend Projection, with Minimum Absolute Deviation to significantly reduce the forecasting error while predicting the future required quantity. The research work aims to contribute to the inventory management literature in three ways. First, a new comparative analysis matrix concept for identifying the most critical items is introduced. Second, a Multi-Criteria Forecasting Model is developed to capture a wide range of operations. Third, the paper suggests how these forecasting criteria can be integrated into a single interactive DSS to maintain optimum inventory level stock. Even though the DSS framework is based on data from a single organization, the application is expected to manage inventory stock in a wide range of manufacturing and services industries. This study's proposed hybrid framework is the first of its kind that encapsulates all four dimensions of inventory classification criteria, forming a multi-criteria hybrid model within a DSS framework.",No specific funding was received for this study.,No specific funding was received for this study.,PLOS ONE,,Abid Hussain,Decision Trees; Forecasting; Industry,44246,2021,44246,,16,2,e0247144,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rehmani, Khurram; Naseem, Afshan; Ahmad, Yasir; Mirza, Muhammad Zeeshan; Syed, Tasweer Hussain","Rehmani, Khurram (Department of Engineering Management, College of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan); Naseem, Afshan (Department of Engineering Management, College of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan); Ahmad, Yasir (Department of Engineering Management, College of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan); Mirza, Muhammad Zeeshan (Department of Engineering Management, College of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan); Syed, Tasweer Hussain (Department of Engineering Management, College of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, National University of Sciences & Technology (NUST), Islamabad, Pakistan)","Rehmani, Khurram (National University of Sciences and Technology)","Rehmani, Khurram (National University of Sciences and Technology); Naseem, Afshan (National University of Sciences and Technology); Ahmad, Yasir (National University of Sciences and Technology); Mirza, Muhammad Zeeshan (National University of Sciences and Technology); Syed, Tasweer Hussain (National University of Sciences and Technology)",3,2,0.29,1.68,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0247144&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135471864,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems",

As businesses grapple with the risks of cyber-incidents and their imperfect ability to prevent them, attention has shifted toward risk management and insurance. While there have been efforts to understand the costs of cyber attacks, the systemic risk-a result of risks spreading across interdependent systems-associated with cyber attacks remains a critical and problem in need of further study. We contribute a theoretical framework that describes systemic cyber risk as the result of cascading, common cause, or independent failures following a cyber incident. We construct a quantitative model of cascading failures to estimate the potential economic damage associated with a given cyber incident. We present an interdisciplinary approach for extending standard sector-level input-output analyses to the cyber domain, which has not been done. We estimate the aggregate losses associated with firm-level incidents, a contribution to risk analysis and computational economic modeling. We use this model to estimate the impact of potential cyber incidents and compare model results to a case with known damages. Finally, we use the model of systemic cyber failure to consider the implications on the growing cyber insurance market and the need for broader cyber policy. While we discuss the topic of systemic cyber risk, our contribution of using I/O analysis to estimate the aggregate losses from firm-level incidents is applicable across a variety of risk analysis applications from environment to health.","The authors would like to thank the RAND Institute of Civil Justice, the members of its board, and Director James Anderson for their support of this work and for their useful comments.

        COVIDÉ?ê19 pandemic unleashed uncertainties around the world. Organizations scrambled to ensure business continuity. COVIDÉ?ê19 pandemic was unprecedented as disruptions were far beyond business continuity scenarios planning with respect to severities, timelines, and geographies. Initially, business disruptions were assumed to last just for a few days or weeks at a local governing region, county, or state level. However, the pandemic lasted much longer and sustained efforts were needed to stay compliant with everÉ?êevolving and changing local, state, federal, and international guidelines, rules, and regulations. Prolonged work from home became an unavoidable and only way to ensure business continuity for many serviceÉ?êoriented organizations. Organizations not only tried to leverage existing knowledge management (KM) practices but also were compelled to critically relook at the efficacy and effectiveness of KM practices. Organizational KM systems and practices (OKMSP) in a typical Indian engineering consulting and design organization were studied. The changes in employee perceptions about OKMSP during the pandemic period were captured and critically analyzed. The study evaluated employee perceptions related to four critical aspects of OKMSP namely, KM processes, usage of KM tools, KM effectiveness, and KM culture.

The directions for creating a methodology for measuring resilience are proposed, based on a study of theoretical and methodological approaches and existing attempts to measure the resilience of cities and regions. The article describes existing Russian examples of measuring the resilience of regions a posteriori (by analyzing the behavior of indicators of socioeconomic development during and after economic and budgetary crises) and a priori (based on the characteristics of industry structure or risk resistance of the economic, social, and governance subsystems of a region). A paradox is noted: in Russia, subsidization of a region and a backward structure of the economy are factors that increase resilience. Ways are shown to embed mechanisms for increasing resilience in the strategic governance system of urban and regional development. It is proposed to introduce resilience auditing into management practice and create a regional (municipal) risk-management system and the position of a risk manager.",,,Regional Research of Russia,,,,2021-01,2021,44303,2021-01,11,1,45299,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Zhikharevich, B.

According to the socioemotional wealth theory, family firms place significant emphasis on sustainable development and long-term orientation, but this emphasis can be either internally or externally driven according to the type of involvement chosen by the owning family. Therefore, this study uses listed family firms to explore the relationship between different types of family involvement (i.e., family ownership and control, the influence of market competition, and the institutionalisation level of the environment in which a firm decides to pursue ESG criteria). We performed a multivariate regression analysis on a sample of 1,151 Chinese companies to test these relationships and found that both family ownership and control are positively related to ESG scores. Market competition negatively moderates the influence of both family ownership and control on the adoption of ESG criteria. Moreover, the influence of family control is negatively moderated by the institutional environment. Thus, types of family involvement seem to be relevant for the firmÉ??s engagement with ESG criteria.",,,Review of Managerial Science,,,,44992,2023,44992,2024-04,18,4,1015-1046,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Sun, Jiamu; Pellegrini, Massimiliano Matteo; Dabié?, Marina; Wang, Kai; Wang, Cizhi","Sun, Jiamu (School of Economics and Management, Beijing Jiatong University, Beijing, China); Pellegrini, Massimiliano Matteo (Department of Management and Law, Tor Vergata University, Rome, Italy); Dabié?, Marina (Faculty of Economics and Business, University of Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia; University of Dubrovnik, Dubrovnik, Croatia; School of Economics and Business, University of Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia); Wang, Kai (College of Business Administration, Capital University of Economics and Business, Beijing, China); Wang, Cizhi (College of Business Administration, Capital University of Economics and Business, Beijing, China)","Dabié?, Marina (University of Zagreb; University of Dubrovnik; University of Ljubljana)","Sun, Jiamu (School of Economics and Management, Beijing Jiatong University, Beijing, China); Pellegrini, Massimiliano Matteo (University of Rome Tor Vergata); Dabié?, Marina (University of Zagreb; University of Dubrovnik; University of Ljubljana); Wang, Kai (Capital University of Economics and Business); Wang, Cizhi (Capital University of Economics and Business)",9,9,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11846-023-00631-2.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156002472,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

This paper uses the Piracy and Armed Robbery dataset in the Global Integrated Shipping Information System to analyze the types and evolutionary characteristics of shipping risk caused by piracy and the piracy behavior patterns in different seas. This study found that there are three regions with high incidence of piracy in the world, and their gathering centers change dynamically over time. Piracy incidents can be divided into four categories based on the quantitative assessment of shipping risk caused by piracy. Shipping risk caused by piracy shows different evolution characteristics in different seas, affected by factors such as the evolution of national political situations and anti-piracy measures. Based on the qualitative assessment of the shipping risk caused by piracy, the piracy corpus reflects the diverse patterns of piracy in different seas. In the process of pirate attacks, the diversity is mainly manifested in violence and selectivity. In the consequences of pirate attacks, the targets that pirates pay attention to vary significantly in different seas. This research will help to strengthen the dynamic monitoring of shipping risk caused by piracy, and further contribute to the research on maritime transport safety.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,This work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 42071151) to Prof. Wang.,Heliyon,,,,45213,2023,45213,2023-10,9,10,e20988,All OA; Gold,Article,"He, Zhaoyang; Wang, Chengjin; Gao, Jianbo; Xie, Yongshun","He, Zhaoyang (Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China); Wang, Chengjin (Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China; College of Resources and Environment, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100049, China); Gao, Jianbo (Center for Geodata and Analysis, Faculty of Geographical Science, Beijing Normal University, Beijing, 100087, China; Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100087, China); Xie, Yongshun (State Key Joint Laboratory of ESPC, School of Environment, Tsinghua University, Beijing, 100084, China; Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, 100101, China)","Wang, Chengjin (Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences)","He, Zhaoyang (Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences); Wang, Chengjin (Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research; University of Chinese Academy of Sciences); Gao, Jianbo (Beijing Normal University; Institute of Automation); Xie, Yongshun (Tsinghua University; Institute of Geographic Sciences and Natural Resources Research)",0,0,,,http://www.cell.com/article/S2405844023081963/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1164941336,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3505 Human Resources and Industrial Relations","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

The interest of this article is to examine the relative impact of market, nonmarket strategy, and strategy integration on the performance of medium and large organizations in Portugal. Furthermore, environmental uncertainty and firm capabilities were used as moderation to evaluate the performance implication of these strategy configurations on firm market advantage in the host country. Given the need to examine the relationship between the latent and measured variables in this study, structural equation models were used to test the stated hypotheses, while confirmatory factor analyses were used to assess the fitness of our model. Our findings revealed that strategy integration provides a more sustainable competitive performance than either market or nonmarket strategy when used separately, especially in highly regulated and standardized business contexts such as Portugal. Furthermore, our findings show that organization needs to design market-oriented strategies and select the types of nonmarket practices (lobbying, campaign contributions, etc.) that best fit and align with their overall corporate objectives without neglecting the host market environmental culture. Research on market and nonmarket integrations have long been overdue given its extensive proposition to firm sustainable performance in a foreign country. Our research shed light on the importance of strategy integration to combat the ever-changing dynamism of the business environment and the negative sentiment surrounding globalization and how a firm can successfully compete in an uncertain, highly regulated, and standardized market context.","We would like to specially appreciate the editor of this journal and the two peer reviewers who took out time from their busy schedules to help improve the quality and presentation of this manuscriptl; we say thank you very much.

This approach has come under scrutiny, as evidence has emerged of the oligarchs' successful evasion of these punishments. To address this problem, we analyze the role of an overlooked but highly influential group: the secretive professional intermediaries who create and administer the oligarchs' offshore financial empires. Drawing on the Offshore Leaks Database provided by the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), we examine the ties linking offshore expert advisors (lawyers, accountants, and other wealth management professionals) to ultra-high-net-worth individuals from four countries: Russia, China, the USA, and Hong Kong. We find that resulting nation-level ""oligarch networks"" share a scale-free structure characterized by a heterogeneity of heavy-tailed degree distributions of wealth managers; however, network topologies diverge across clients from democratic versus autocratic regimes. While generally robust, scale-free networks are fragile when targeted by attacks on highly connected nodes. Our ""knock-out"" experiments pinpoint this vulnerability to the small group of wealth managers themselves, suggesting that sanctioning these professional intermediaries may be more effective and efficient in disrupting dark finance flows than sanctions on their wealthy clients. This vulnerability is especially pronounced amongst Russian oligarchs, who concentrate their offshore business in a handful of boutique wealth management firms. The distinctive patterns we identify suggest a new approach to sanctions, focused on expert intermediaries to disrupt the finances and alliances of their wealthy clients. More generally, our research contributes to the larger body of work on complexity science and the structures of secrecy.","The authors would like to thank Neils Johannesen, Finn Tarp, Bob Rijker, and UNU-WIDER for feedback.

A unique dataset covering 2259 social media entries by tourists during the quarantine were compiled manually and examined. Tourists' concerns and emotions demonstrate two salient characteristics of the enactment of the crisis scene: expressing cautious optimism and crafting realistic lifestyle. Findings demonstrate the resilience of tourists under extreme circumstances, elucidate similarities and differences of tourists' experience mediated by language, and show their supportive attitude toward tourist industry players.

The most pressing challenge is deterring criminal behaviour in both the physical and cyber realms through the adoption of CAV cybersecurity protocols and regulations. However, the literature lacks a systematic decision tool to analyze the impact of the potential cybersecurity regulations for dynamically interacting stakeholders, and to identify the leverage points to minimise the cyber-risks. To address this knowledge gap, this study uses systems theory to develop a dynamic modelling tool to analyze the indirect consequences of potential CAVs cybersecurity regulations in the medium to long term. It is hypothesized that CAVs Cybersecurity Regulatory Framework (CRF) is the property of the entire ITS stakeholders. The CRF is modelled using the System Dynamic based Stock-and-Flow-Model (SFM) technique. The SFM is founded on five critical pillars: the Cybersecurity Policy Stack, the Hacker's Capability, Logfiles, CAV Adopters, and intelligence-assisted traffic police. It is found that decision-makers should focus on three major leverage points: establishing a CRF grounded on automakers' innovation; sharing risks in eliminating negative externalities associated with underinvestment and knowledge asymmetries in cybersecurity; and capitalising on massive CAV-generated data in CAV operations. The formal integration of intelligence analysts and computer crime investigators to strengthen traffic police capabilities is pivotal. Recommendations for automakers include data-profiteering in CAV design, production, sales, marketing, safety enhancements and enabling consumer data transparency.Furthermore, CAVs-CRF necessitate a balanced approach to the trade-off between: i) data accessibility constraints on CAV automakers and ITS service providers; ii) regulator command and control thresholds; iii) automakers' business investment protection; and iv) consumers' data privacy guard.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Accident Analysis & Prevention,,,"Humans; Accidents, Traffic; Autonomous Vehicles; Communication; Computer Security; Intelligence",45020,2023,45020,2023-06,186,,107054,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Khalid Khan, Shah; Shiwakoti, Nirajan; Stasinopoulos, Peter; Warren, Matthew","Khalid Khan, Shah (School of Engineering, RMIT University Melbourne, Australia.

This paper examines the determinants of formal institutions around new areas of economic activities. Specifically, we propose a framework for understanding how the quality of formal institutions in promoting entrepreneurship drives the focus of such institutions concerning initial coin offering (ICO), which is emerging as a popular fundraising method. The paper uses inductive analysis to examine how nonmarket factorsÉ??such as a jurisdictionÉ??s tax haven nature, regulatorsÉ?? perceptions of ICOs as threats to national or political interests, and trade and industry associationsÉ??might moderate the relationship between the quality of institutions and the focus of such institutions regarding ICOs. One of this studyÉ??s key findings is that an economyÉ??s quality of entrepreneurship-related institutions, perceived threats to national/political interests, and tax haven nature lead to different policy orientations. Consequently, regulators assign different importance when promoting crypto-entrepreneurship and dealing with associated risks. Regulators focusing mainly on promoting crypto-ventures have taken measures to enrich the blockchain ecosystem and provided tax and non-tax incentives to attract such ventures. Regulators focusing mainly on dealing with crypto-venture risks rely on a regulatory sandbox and close regulatory monitoring of such ventures.",,No funding was received for this project.,Financial Innovation,,,,44932,2023,44932,2023,9,1,9,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kshetri, Nir","Kshetri, Nir (The University of North Carolina at Greensboro, Greensboro, USA)","Kshetri, Nir (University of North Carolina at Greensboro)","Kshetri, Nir (University of North Carolina at Greensboro)",4,4,,,https://jfin-swufe.springeropen.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s40854-022-00405-x,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1154265122,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

This is, of course true, until the smart factories in the supply chains get connected to each other, with their systems and the machines linked to a common networking system. The last few years have experienced an increase in the adoption and acceptance of the industry 4.0's components. However, the next stage of smart factories, which will be the smart supply chains, is still in its period of infancy. Moreover, there is a simultaneous need to maintain a focus on the supply chain level implementation of the concept that industry 4.0 puts forth. This is important in order to gain the end to end benefits, while also avoiding the organization to organization compatibility issues that may follow later on. When considering this concept, limited research exists on the issues related to the implementation of industry 4.0, at the supply chain level. Hence, keeping in mind this lack of literature and research available, on a phenomenon that will define the future of business and industry, this study uses an exploratory approach to capture the implementation of industry 4.0 concepts across multiple tiers of the supply chain. Based on this research, the study proposes a multistage implementation framework that highlights the organizational enablers such as culture, cross-functional approach, and the continuous improvement activities.

A spatially explicit analysis is needed to identify the specific sources and distribution of Hg-related health impacts. This study maps China's Hg-related health impacts and global supply chain drivers (i.e., global final consumers and primary suppliers) at a high spatial resolution. Here we show significant spatial heterogeneity in hotspots of China's Hg-related health impacts. Approximately 1% of the land area holds only 40% of the Chinese population but nearly 70% of the fatal heart attack deaths in China. Moreover, approximately 3% of the land area holds nearly 60% of the population but 70% of the intelligence quotient (IQ) decrements. The distribution of hotspots of China's Hg-related health impacts and global supply chain drivers are influenced by various factors including population, economy, transportation, resources, and dietary intake habits. These spatially explicit hotspots can support more effective policies in various stages of the global supply chains and more effective international cooperation to reduce Hg-related health impacts.

There are many risks in the process of innovation in engineering technology, such as shortage of funds, policy fluctuations, and difficulties in the transformation of achievements. Meanwhile, innovation organizations involve multiple participants, which makes cooperation complicated. Therefore, resilient innovation is proposed and considered as a tool that can optimize innovation management. The resilience of innovation depends largely on partnerships at the organizational level, which is rarely explored in current studies. This research aims to examine the relationship between organizational resilience and innovation network characteristics. Based on a survey of 164 participants in infrastructure innovation projects, the structural equation model (SEM) is used to explore the factors that influence organizational resilience. The findings show that there is a positive correlation between network characteristics and organizational resilience. Furthermore, the strength of network connections has a direct impact on the preventive and resistance ability of resilience. Network heterogeneity has an impact on the dual ability of resilience. Finally, a case study of the Qinghai-Tibet Railway innovation network shows that based on the above influence paths, we can find a strategy to reconstruct the network to improve resilience.","This research was funded by the National Science Foundation of China, under 71942006.",,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,Tariq Ahamad,Humans; Organizational Innovation; Surveys and Questionnaires,44819,2022,44819,44819,2022,,1727030,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sun, Ruijiao; Liu, Yisheng; Zhao, Jianghu","Sun, Ruijiao (School of Economics and Management, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing 100044, China, njtu.edu.cn); Liu, Yisheng (School of Economics and Management, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing 100044, China, njtu.edu.cn); Zhao, Jianghu (Beijing General Municipal Engineering Design & Research Institute Co., Ltd., Beijing 100082, China)","Sun, Ruijiao (Beijing Jiaotong University)","Sun, Ruijiao (Beijing Jiaotong University); Liu, Yisheng (Beijing Jiaotong University); Zhao, Jianghu (Beijing Municipal Engineering Design and Research Institute (China))",3,3,,3.15,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2022/1727030.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151038737,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour","11 Sustainable Cities and Communities; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

In this study we undertake a comprehensive analysis of the impact of COVID-19 related uncertainty on global industry returns and volatility using a sample of 68 global industries and Google Trends search data to measure COVID-19 related uncertainty. The results indicate that COVID-19 related uncertainty negatively impacts returns on all industries and generally leads to higher volatility. We interpret these findings as uncertainty related to the future financial performance of firms and emerging opportunities for some industries. Certain industries are more resilient than others and increased uncertainty is not only necessarily associated with industries that experienced the largest negative returns. We also find that new factors emerged in the return generating process during the COVID-19 period. We show that despite an uncertain climate, some industries performed well, yielding positive cumulative abnormal returns that at times are greater than during the pre-COVID-19 period.

The literature on the topic is still fragmented; the features of the emerging paradigm appear to be a contested territory among different academic disciplines. This study assumes a value chain perspective to analyze the evolutionary trajectories of manufacturing companies. We developed a Delphi-based scenario analysis involving 76 experts from academia and practice. The results highlight the most common expectations as well as controversial issues in terms of emerging business models, size, barriers to entry, vertical integration, rent distribution, and geographical location of activities. Eight scenarios provide a concise outlook on the range of possible futures. These scenarios are based on four main drivers which stem from the experts' comments: demand characteristics, transparency of data among value chain participants, maturity of additive manufacturing and advanced robotics, and penetration of smart products. Researchers can derive from our study a series of hypotheses and opportunities for future research on Industry 4.0.

This paper analyzes two strategies that the manufacturer with limited environment-friendly capacity may take to tackle this problem, i.e., investing in building environment-friendly capacities and collaborating with the manufacturer with sufficient environment-friendly capacity in capacity sharing. In a supply chain with two competing manufacturers, this paper builds game-theoretical models and investigates equilibrium solutions under three scenarios (no capacity investment or sharing, capacity investment, and capacity sharing). Then this research investigates the feasible regions of these two strategies and compares the performance of each manufacturer under each scenario. The findings show that both capacity investment and capacity sharing can effectively reduce the profit loss of the manufacturer with limited capacity, while only capacity sharing benefits both manufacturers. The feasibility of these two strategies depends on the initial capacity volume and the capacity investment cost coefficient of the manufacturer with limited capacity. Moreover, the preference of the manufacturer with limited capacity for each strategy depends on the capacity investment cost coefficient. When the capacity investment cost coefficient is relatively high, the win-win situation exists for supply chain members. Furthermore, with the use of chaos theory, the paper shows how to adjust the capacity investment in each period to keep the system stable.",The authors would like to thank the editors and referees for their valuable comments and suggestions to help improve this paper.,"The research was funded by Science Foundation of Ministry of Education of China (Grant No. 20YJC630166), Social Science Foundation of Shandong Province of China (Grant No. 20DGLJO10) and the Fundamental Research Funds of Shandong University.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,"Commerce; Conservation of Energy Resources; Conservation of Natural Resources; Investments; Models, Theoretical",44044,2020,44053,44044,17,16,5790,All OA; Gold,Article,"Xie, Lei; Han, Hongshuai","Xie, Lei (School of Management, Shandong University, Jinan 250100, China;, lxie@sdu.edu.cn); Han, Hongshuai (College of Management and Economics, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China)","Han, Hongshuai (Tianjin University)","Xie, Lei (Shandong University); Han, Hongshuai (Tianjin University)",17,12,0.5,6.7,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/16/5790/pdf?version=1597131148,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130035473,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains","9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

This paper presents a real and financial social accounting matrix (FSAM) capable of distinguishing the direct and indirect effects that are transferred from micro-, small, medium, and large firms to the rest of the economy. We use the hypothetical extraction method (HEM) to explore the sequence of reactions associated with shocks that arise from the COVID-19 lockdown. Using a structural model for the Spanish economy, we identify the role of different firm size categories in the aggregate gross domestic product (GDP). Our results allow us to reconcile the mixed narrative that accompanies the evaluation of the role played by these categories in economic activity by revealing that both SMEs and large firms are important for supporting economic activity. In particular, SMEs help explain 43% of the income and two-thirds of the unemployment decline caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Our findings also show the importance of conditioning SME industrial policy to sectoral analysis.Plain English summaryThe effects of the macroeconomic lockdown and its transmission to the rest of the economy?ˇdiffer by firm size and across sectors. Using the Spanish context for micro-, small, medium, and large firms, we distinguish the direct and indirect effects caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The main implications are the following: (1) Research: results emphasize that SMEs and large firms are both important to support economic activity but, in order to account for the relative effects on SMEs, it is crucial to consider the specific sector that receives the disruption. 2) Policy: SMEs are an important focus of business support policies within the EU. According to our estimations, disruptions in SMEs produce larger reductions in demand. These results could support credit policies for SMEs with a strong impact on the aggregate economy due to their greater productive and financial linkages with the domestic economy.","We are grateful for the valuable comments and suggestions received from two anonymous reviewers, and for the outstanding developmental guidance throughout the reviewing process from SBE Editorial Board.

This has been attributed to the governmentÉ??s robust financial support to the supply chain and logistics industry during the pandemic (Atayah et al. 2021). The UAE imports over 90% of its commodities from overseasÉ??including foods, drinks, pharmaceuticals, automobiles, clothing, electronics, building materials, logs, paper, plants, machinery, tools, and raw materials. All these products pass through the operations of the countryÉ??s supply chain industry, which depends heavily on the financial institutions. Due to the above assertion, we found it necessary to empirically examine the challenges, threats and successes of the countryÉ??s supply chain operators in order to ascertain their financial and business resilience during the pandemic based on the survival strategies and financial resources they received and employed during the unrelenting pandemic. Accordingly, this research has examined the financial and operational resilience of the countryÉ??s supply chain organizations as reflected in their ability to maintain efficient financial strategies and stable business operations despite the scourging pandemic. Our initial findings indicate that Covid-19 pandemic interruptions on the nationwide distribution of goods and services in the UAE have been very minimal due to the governmentÉ??s robust financial support to the logistics industry, and consequently the business resilience developed by the industry operators.","The authors would like to acknowledge the support provided by Subhansu Singhvi and Devavrata Dixit in collecting data about the industry and for providing additional support.

Selikoff MD, the founder of this journal, is indeed welcome now more than two decades after his passing. He was known during his lifetime as the US Father of Environmental Medicine which at the time encompassed occupational medicine and much more as industry also polluted the general environment. The 1970s were a busy time as OSHA and the EPA were newly formed and high exposures to workers were no exception. Dr. Selikoff was a brave pioneer examining workers throughout the country and Canada, publicizing their exposures, and writing and presenting the scientific results. Industry was not always receptive and controlled an astounding amount of narrative, with the creation of the American Journal of Industrial Medicine filling a void of scientific need. We four authors write about the ethics of occupational health, the plight of nuclear energy workers, the climate crisis and opportunity for unions to engage workers, and the global march toward educating medical students on workers' health and safety. All four of us interacted with Dr. Selikoff during his tenure at Mount Sinai, and over the years joined each other in promoting his legacy. Toward that end we have written articles honoring his memory.","ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This study arose from an assignment Knut Ringen received from the Blue Ribbon Commission on America&#x27;s Nuclear Future (BRC) in 2010.

Comparing sustainability connection in emotional and cognitive environments among football fans and university students,"Environmental sustainability is an imperative topic in contemporary business-related research, aiming to understand and predict how individuals' environmentally friendly behaviors can be encouraged. This research aims to empirically examine the relationship between individuals' pro-environmental attitude and pro-environmental behavior; and to compare two groups of individuals that encompass emotional and cognitive links to environmental sustainability: emotionally involved sport fans and socially conscious university students. Two studies, involving more than 1400 respondents, were conducted. Study 1 uses structural equation modelling (SEM) to test the relationship between consumers' environmental attitudes and environmental behaviors. Study 2 uses SEM multigroup analysis to compare the attitudes and behaviors of sport fans and university students. The results showed that participants' pro-environmental attitude had a positive and significant effect on pro-environmental behavior. The type of consumer plays an important role in strengthening the relationship between pro-environmental attitude and pro-environmental behavior. Despite the higher average levels of pro-environmental attitude and pro-environment behavior evidenced by the sport fans, the influence of attitude on behavior is higher on socially conscious students, the group with a more cognitive and intrinsic link with the natural environment and sustainability initiatives. Despite the positive link attitudes-behaviors, empirical insights suggest that the connection between sport fans and the club is vital to reinforce the commitment with a stronger match between attitudes and behaviors. The findings also have implications for practitioners and policymakers in optimizing their strategies to encourage effective pro-environmental actions.","Declaration of competing interest This work was supported by the UIDB/05105/2020 Program Contract, funded by national funds through the FCT I.P.",,Heliyon,,,,45237,2023,45237,2023-11,9,11,e21758,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cayolla, Ricardo; Escadas, Marco; McCullough, Brian P.; Biscaia, Rui; Cabilhas, Ana; Santos, Teresa","Cayolla, Ricardo (Portucalense University, Department of Economics and Management, REMIT/Consumer Neuroscience Lab, Rua Dr. Ant??nio Bernardino de Almeida, n.?¯ 541/619, 4200-072 Porto, Portugal); Escadas, Marco (University of Minho, School of Economics and Management, Campus de Gualtar, 4710-057 Braga, Portugal; Portucalense University, Department of Economics and Management, REMIT/Consumer Neuroscience Lab, Rua Dr. Ant??nio Bernardino de Almeida, n.?¯ 541/619, 4200-072 Porto, Portugal); McCullough, Brian P.

The tourism industry is vulnerable to a range of economic and political factors, which can have both short-term and long-term impacts on tourist arrivals. The study aims to investigate the temporal dynamics of these factors and their impact on tourist arrivals. The method employed is a panel data regression analysis, using data from BRICS economies over a period of 1980É??2020. The dependent variable is the number of tourist arrivals, while the independent variables are geopolitical risk, currency fluctuation, and economic policy. Control variables such as GDP, exchange rate, and distance to major tourist destinations are also included. The results show that geopolitical risk and currency fluctuation have a significant negative impact on tourist arrivals, while economic policy has a positive impact. The study also finds that the impact of geopolitical risk is stronger in the short term, while the impact of economic policy is stronger in the long term. Additionally, the study shows that the effects of these factors on tourist arrivals vary across BRICS countries. The policy implications of this study suggest that BRICS economies need to develop proactive economic policies that promote stability and encourage investment in the tourism industry.","The third author would like to thank Robert B.

However, the question of how it affects corporate vulnerability has received less attention. This article aims to fill this gap by examining the implications of COVID-19 on corporate vulnerability in the United States (US) and China, using daily data from January 2020 to December 2021. The empirical results of cointegration analysis demonstrate that COVID-19 considerably worsen corporate vulnerabilities in the long-term in the US and in the short-term in China. Additionally, non-linear results demonstrate long-run asymmetries in the US and short-run asymmetries in China, confirming the accuracy of error prediction and suggesting that US corporations are more exposed to COVID-19-induced risks. The channels through which COVID-19 may affect corporate vulnerability include changes in consumer behavior and demand, disruptions in supply chains, financial stress, government policies and regulations, and changes in the competitive landscape. This study sheds light on the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on corporate vulnerability in the US and China, revealing regulatory implications that may necessitate greater government involvement, managerial implications that emphasize risk management and contingency planning, and social implications that highlight the importance of prioritizing stakeholder welfare and embracing digital transformation.","Declaration of competing interest This manuscript has been completed and agreed upon by all the authors, and they declare no conflict of interest.

It shows that systemic vulnerabilities to natural hazards have been created by inadequate aid responses and longer-term chronic problems and demonstrates that hazard impacts are compounded by them. Vulnerabilities could be reduced by analysing integrated hazard impacts to generate mitigative measures across hazards and identify actions that more closely match timescales of political decision-making. Incorporating local knowledge and experience into risk analysis will enable the most effective use of aid resources, ahead of emergencies.

Research gap: Only a few studies evaluated decontamination effectiveness against SARS-CoV-2 that are practical for low-resource settings. This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of a relatively inexpensive ultraviolet germicidal irradiation chamber to decontaminate FFRs contaminated with SARS-CoV-2. A custom-designed UVGI chamber was constructed to determine the ability to decontaminate seven FFR models including N95s, KN95, and FFP2s inoculated with SARS-CoV-2. Vflex was excluded due to design folds/pleats and UVGI shadowing inside the chamber. Structural and functional integrity tolerated by each FFR model on repeated decontamination cycles was assessed. Twenty-seven participants were fit-tested over 30 cycles for each model and passed if the fit factor was É?ù100. Of the FFR models included for testing, only the KN95 model failed filtration. The 3MÉ?õ 3M 1860 and HalyardÉ?õ duckbill 46727 (formerly Kimberly Clark) models performed better on fit testing than other models for both pre-and-post decontaminations. Fewer participants (0.3 and 0.7%, respectively) passed fit testing for Makrite 9500 N95 and Greenline 5200 FFP2 and only two for the KN95 model post decontamination. Fit testing appeared to be more affected by donning & doffing, as some passed with adjustment and repeat fit testing. AÉ??É?ùÉ??3 log reduction of SARS-CoV-2 was achieved for worn-in FFRs namely Greenline 5200 FFP2. Conclusion: The study showed that not all FFRs tested could withstand 30 cycles of UVGI decontamination without diminishing filtration efficiency or facial fit. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 log reduction varied across the FFRs, implying that the decontamination efficacy largely depends on the decontamination protocol and selection of FFRs. We demonstrated the effectiveness of a low-cost and scalable decontamination method for SARS-CoV-2 and the effect on fit testing using people instead of manikins. It is recognized that extensive experimental evidence for the reuse of decontaminated FFRs is lacking, and thus this study would be relevant and of interest in crisis-capacity settings, particularly in low-resource facilities.","We thank all participants for performing the fit testing.

It poses security challenges in the form of cyber-attacks, prompting rigorous cybersecurity measures. There is a lack of knowledge on the anticipated cause-effect relationships and mechanisms of CAVs cybersecurity and the possible system behaviour, especially the unintended consequences. Therefore, this study aims to develop a conceptual System Dynamics (SD) model to analyse cybersecurity in the complex, uncertain deployment of CAVs. Specifically, the SD model integrates six critical avenues and maps their respective parameters that either trigger or mitigate cyber-attacks in the operation of CAVs using a systematic theoretical approach. These six avenues are: i) CAVs communication framework, ii) secured physical access, iii) human factors, iv) CAVs penetration, v) regulatory laws and policy framework, and iv) trust-across the CAVs-industry and among the public. Based on the conceptual model, various system archetypes are analysed. ""Fixes that Fail"", in which the upsurge in hacker capability is the unintended natural result of technology maturity, requires continuous efforts to combat it. The primary mitigation steps are human behaviour analysis, knowledge of motivations and characteristics of CAVs cyber-attackers, CAVs users and Original Equipment Manufacturers education. ""Shifting the burden"", where policymakers counter the perceived cyber threats of hackers by updating legislation that also reduces CAVs adaptation by imitations, indicated the need for calculated regulatory and policy intervention. The ""limits to success"" triggered by CAVs penetration increase the defended hacks to establish regulatory laws, improve trust, and develop more human analysis. However, it may also open up caveats for cyber-crimes and alert that CAVs deployment to be alignment with the intended goals for enhancing cybersecurity. The proposed model can support decision-making and training and stimulate the roadmap towards an optimized, self-regulating, and resilient cyber-safe CAV system.","We would like to acknowledge the Australian Government, Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources (DISER) for the financial support received for this study through Automotive Engineering Graduate Program (GRANT NO: AEGP000050).

This is especially the case for commodities required for new and emerging technologies ranging from electric vehicles to wind turbines. In this analysis, we use a conventional risk-modeling framework to develop and apply a new methodology for assessing the supply risk to the U.S. manufacturing sector. Specifically, supply risk is defined as the confluence of three factors: the likelihood of a foreign supply disruption, the dependency of U.S. manufacturers on foreign supplies, and the ability of U.S. manufacturers to withstand a supply disruption. The methodology is applied to 52 commodities for the decade spanning 2007-2016. The results indicate that a subset of 23 commodities, including cobalt, niobium, rare earth elements, and tungsten, pose the greatest supply risk. This supply risk is dynamic, shifting with changes in global market conditions.","We would like to thank the specialists at the National Minerals Information Center at the U.S. Geological Survey for input and feedback.

Some industries have publicly reported at least some degree of information regarding their PFAS use, while other industries have reported little, if any, such information publicly.
METHODS: Publicly available sources were extensively researched for information. Literature searches were performed on key words via a variety of search mechanisms, including existing PFAS use and synthesis literature, patent databases, manufacturers' websites, public government databases, and library catalogs. Additional searches were conducted specifically for suspected or known uses.
RESULTS: PFAS have been used in a wide variety of applications, which are summarized into several industries and applications. The expanded literature search yielded additional references as well as greater details, such as concentrations and specific PFAS used, on several previously reported uses.
CONCLUSIONS: This knowledge will help inform which industries and occupations may lead to potential exposure to workers and to the environment.","ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS I would like to thank Antony Williams and Ann Richard for their help using the EPA&#x27;s Chemicals Dashboard lists that helped identify chemicals and also Inthirany Thillainadarajah, Brian Meyer, and Vicente Samano for curating, identifying, and adding new PFAS that I found into EPA&#x27;s Chemicals Dashboard.

We hypothesise that the number of hand injuries is correlated to activity in the construction and manufacturing industries in Singapore.MethodsTwenty thousand seven hundred sixty-four patients who underwent hand surgeries in a tertiary institution between 2012 to 2018 were reviewed. Two independent, blinded observers extracted the frequency of hand surgeries performed from Electronic Medical Records. Economic indicators pertinent to SingaporeÉ??s economic activity were collected and smoothed by simple moving average of the prior 3É??months. Results were analysed using IBM SPSS v25.0.ResultsSignificant independent univariate variables were Purchasing-Manager-Index and Industrial-Production-Index.

The main aim of the paper is to demonstrate the above average and utilitarian significance of the multiple probabilistic traveling salesman problem (MPTSP) in the coordination and modeling of sustainable product transportation, which is a novelty at the theoretical, conceptual, methodological and empirical level. We propose a new, hybrid algorithm of solving MPTSP instances (it connects harmony search, k-means and 2-opt), which can be successfully used in economic practice for coordination and modeling of Industry 4.0. The effectiveness of proposed approach is tested using a case study of drugs distribution services and datasets obtained from the transportation enterprise located in Poland. The study focuses on the issue of planning routes, with particular emphasis on the changing demand of customers. It should be stressed that this work may be of interest to researchers but also to management practitioners. The value added of this research lies in the innovative modeling the coordination of sustainable drug transportation as an instance of MPTSP and proposing an effective method to solve it.

Therefore, it is necessary to start with the logistics mode of land transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong, reduce the cost of customs clearance by land transportation between Guangdong and Hong Kong, and increase the trade volume by land transportation between the two places. This paper systematically analyzes the present situation of customs clearance efficiency in China and introduces BPNN (BP neural network) algorithm to optimize customs clearance. The detailed idea and process of the algorithm are introduced, and the BPNN trained by the algorithm is applied to function approximation. The simulation results show that this scheme can not only improve the convergence speed of the algorithm in the training process but also the trained BPNN has strong adaptive and self-learning ability. Comparing the customs clearance efficiency before and after the improvement, the results show that the improved customs clearance efficiency is higher and can save a lot of time, thus verifying the effectiveness and applicability of the model-solving algorithm.",,,Computational Intelligence and Neuroscience,,Gengxin Sun,"China; Culture; Hong Kong; Neural Networks, Computer; Transportation",44773,2022,44773,44773,2022,,9964795,All OA; Gold,Article,"You, Linyu","You, Linyu (Guangzhou Huaxia Vocational College, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510900, China)","You, Linyu (Guangzhou Huaxia Vocational College, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510900, China)","You, Linyu (Guangzhou Huaxia Vocational College, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510900, China)",1,1,,0.79,https://downloads.hindawi.com/journals/cin/2022/9964795.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1149902509,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",15 Life on Land

In this paper we perform a systematic literature review of the diverse and somewhat fragmented current state of research on firmsÉ?? internationalization and innovation. We analyze 207 key works from 1989 through 2020 and synthesize them into an internationalization process framework that conceptually maps key internationalization-related antecedents and moderators that influence innovation behaviors and outcomes. Through an internationalization process framework, we categorize existing relevant studies into three key stages: (a) the pre-internationalization stage, (b) the internationalization entry stage, and (c) the post-internationalization stage. Furthermore, we review how firmsÉ?? various strategic decisions and operations in different stages influence their innovations by elaborating the moderating role of external country/region institutions and firm internal characteristics. Building on this review, we provide suggestions for future research to advance the developments of this domain.",,"Open Access funding enabled and organized by CAUL and its Member Institutions We thank for the insightful comments from JiaTao Li on the early version of the paper.

This study aims to analyze the role of the green economy and digitalization for sustainable village economic development with corporate social responsibility as a moderating variable. This research is quantitative descriptive research conducted in the province of Bali. Research data using primary sources were collected using a questionnaire with a Likert scale. Respondents in this study were the community and village officials who carried out activities using technical assistance in government activities and agriculture and plantations. The research sample amounted to 98 people using purposive sampling. Data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling. The research results explain the importance of maintaining sustainable economic growth in the agricultural and plantation sectors in the Province of Bali with good cropping patterns. Green growth and digitalization significantly impact sustainable growth in the economic and financial sectors. Corporate social responsibility can moderate the influence of green growth and digitalization on sustainable village economic development. A green economy ensures that villages can realize economic growth that can reduce poverty and ensure social inclusion, environmental sustainability, and resource efficiency. The digital village program will increase the knowledge and competence of rural communities to use technology in developing their businesses, welfare, and local rural business capabilities. Mainly to improve production, marketing, reputation, and finances to compete with regional and national businesspeople.",,,Heliyon,,,,45018,2023,45018,2023-04,9,4,e15115,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ayu Purnamawati, I Gusti; Yuniarta, Gede Adi; Jie, Ferry","Ayu Purnamawati, I Gusti (Faculty of Economics, Universitas Pendidikan Ganesha, Singaraja, Indonesia.); Yuniarta, Gede Adi (Faculty of Economics, Universitas Pendidikan Ganesha, Singaraja, Indonesia.); Jie, Ferry (School of Business and Law, Edith Cowan University, Joondalup, Australia.)","Ayu Purnamawati, I Gusti (Universitas Pendidikan Ganesha)","Ayu Purnamawati, I Gusti (Universitas Pendidikan Ganesha); Yuniarta, Gede Adi (Universitas Pendidikan Ganesha); Jie, Ferry (Edith Cowan University)",10,10,,,http://www.cell.com/article/S2405844023023228/pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1156862807,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 44 Human Society; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5001 Applied Ethics",8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

However, the existing indicator-based criticality assessments have limitations to capture Eu's supply chain information and thus fall short of reflecting its true criticality. This study quantified the flows and stocks of Eu in mainland China from 1990 to 2018. Results show that: (1) China's Eu demand decreased by 75% from 2011 to 2018, as a result of the lighting technology transition from fluorescent lamps to light-emitting diodes, which significantly reduced Eu's importance; (2) the supply of Eu mined as a byproduct kept increasing together with the growing rare earth production, which caused a substantial supply surplus being É??1900 t by 2018; (3) despite the leading role of China in global Eu production, Eu mined in China was exported mainly in the form of intermediate and final products, and É??90% Eu embedded in domestically produced final products was used for export recently. This study indicates that Eu's criticality is not as severe as previously assessed and highlights the necessity of material flow analysis for a holistic and dynamic view on the entire supply chain of critical minerals.","This work was financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant nos. 41671523, 71904182, and 71961147003) and Key Program of Frontier Science of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (QYZDB-SSW-DQC012).

Construction contractors usually present environmentally fraudulent behaviors, i.e., greenwashing behaviors (GWBs), to legitimize their activities, ultimately hindering the sustainable development of the society. However, the formation mechanism of the contractorsÉ?? GWBs is still unclear. Through the lens of fraud GONE theory (i.e.,?ˇgreed, opportunity, needs, and exposure), this study applies the multi-group structural equation model (SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to examine the formation mechanisms of GWBs. The results of SEM show the relationships between four fraud factors and GWBs. Additionally, the projects are grouped into three categories: government investment projects, privateÉ??public-partnership (PPP) projects, and private investment projects. The results of multi-group SEM reveal that the effects of four fraud factors differ significantly across projects with different investment characteristics. The results of fsQCA suggest that there are three typical driving mechanisms for GWBs.

First, the elements of green technology innovation and their relationships are analyzed and explained. Then, the Complex Adaptive System (CAS) theory is introduced. On this basis, a computer model for the driving mechanism system of corporate green technology innovation is constructed on the Recursive Porus Agent Simulation (Repast) platform. Finally, the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN) model is optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), constituting the PSO-BPNN algorithm to evaluate corporate performance. The results of network training and simulation demonstrate that compared with traditional BPNN, PSO-BPNN achieve a faster convergence speed and fewer errors. Besides, the actual output value has a tiny difference from the expected value, showing the application potential of this algorithm in corporate performance prediction. Moreover, the driving factors of green technology innovation greatly affect the profitability and performance of enterprises. Given insufficient corporate profit margin, continuous technological innovation activities can ensure the normal operation of enterprises. A smaller corporate tax rate can shorten the time for the system to reach equilibrium. When the corporate tax rate is above 0.2, the system takes longer to reach equilibrium. In addition, the public opinion coefficient directly affects the time needed for the system to attain equilibrium. When the public opinion coefficient is within 50,00 ~ 6,000 interval, the time that the system takes to reach equilibrium changes significantly. Furthermore, corporate internal and external driving factors have a direct effect on corporate green technology innovation and performance. The research findings indicate that the PSO-BPNN algorithm is of vital practical value to corporate performance evaluation.",,The authors received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Seyedali Mirjalili,"Computer Simulation; Inventions; Models, Theoretical; Neural Networks, Computer",44589,2022,44589,,17,1,e0262963,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zhang, Xiaomei; Tang, Zhuosi","Zhang, Xiaomei (School of Finance, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, Chengdu, China); Tang, Zhuosi (School of Finance, Southwestern University of Finance and Economics, Chengdu, China)","Tang, Zhuosi (Southwestern University of Finance and Economics)","Zhang, Xiaomei (Southwestern University of Finance and Economics); Tang, Zhuosi (Southwestern University of Finance and Economics)",7,7,2,3.95,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0262963&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145080467,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 40 Engineering; 4005 Civil Engineering; 46 Information and Computing Sciences",

We argue that this issue is primarily explained by the misalignment between a firm's global sourcing strategy and value expected from its global sourcing activities. This study examines the role of global sourcing strategy on financial and innovation performance of global sourcing activities. Using a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis on 235 firms engaging in global sourcing of business service activities, we identify configurations of global sourcing strategyÉ??concerning (1) disaggregation, (2) dispersion of activities and (3) governance structureÉ??that lead to high financial and innovation performance. The findings suggest that global sourcing strategy leading to high financial performance differs largely from global sourcing strategy leading to high innovation. While most studies selectively focus on one or two components of global sourcing strategy, our study highlights the need for firms to jointly consider the combined effect of degree of disaggregation, degree of dispersion of business service activities and governance structure as well as taking into account the expected outcome when crafting their global sourcing strategy.",,,Management International Review,,,,2020-10,2020,44154,2020-10,60,5,723-753,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Lin, Nidthida","Lin, Nidthida (Macquarie Business School, Macquarie University, Sydney, NSW, Australia)","Lin, Nidthida (Macquarie University)","Lin, Nidthida (Macquarie University)",16,12,0.35,7.22,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11575-020-00428-5.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1132728026,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

The aim of this research is to examine the inhibitors that have a major impact on the performance of CSC operations in the United Arab Emirates (UAE). This study provides a synthesis and suggests a hierarchical model among CSC inhibitors and their respective relevance. The hierarchical synthesis of twelve (12) primary CSC inhibitors is achieved through a comprehensive literature review and consultation with academics and CSC professionals. This study used semi-structured interviews, a fuzzy interpretive structural modeling (FISM) and a Fuzzy-MICMAC (FMICMAC) analysis to explore and establish the relationship between and among identified inhibitors. FISM is used to examine the interaction between inhibitors, while FMICMAC analysis is used to examine the nature of inhibitors on the basis of their dependence and driving power. The results of the FISM and FMICMAC analysis show the inter-relationships and relative dominance of identified inhibitors. The results show that some inhibitors are of high strategic importance due to their high driving power and low dependence. These inhibitors seek more management attention in order to improve their effectiveness. The result of a hierarchical model helps to understand the influence of a particular inhibitor on others. 'Higher capital and operating costs' occupy the highest level in the FISM model. The 'fragmented cold supply chains', 'lack of skilled labor', 'inadequate information system infrastructure' and 'lack of commitment by top level management' had strong driving power but weak dependence, which characterizes them as independent inhibitors. Management should be extra careful when dealing with these inhibitors as they influence the effects of other variables at the top of the FISM hierarchy in the overall management of the cold supply chain. The study also suggests a number of recommendations for addressing these inhibitors in cold supply chains operating in the UAE. With due attention and care for these inhibitors, the operation of the cold supply chains is likely to be even more successful.","This study received Internal Research Grant (IRG) (Ref: 2018-A-BN-01) from Ajman University, Ajman, UAE.","This study received Internal Research Grant (IRG) (Ref: 2018-A-BN-01) from Ajman University, Ajman, UAE.",PLOS ONE,,Dragan Pamucar,Food Storage; Food Supply; Frozen Foods; Fuzzy Logic; Logistic Models; Workforce,44299,2021,44299,,16,4,e0249046,All OA; Gold,Article,"Sharma, Anshuman; Abbas, Haidar; Siddiqui, Muhammad Qutubuddin","Sharma, Anshuman (College of Business Administration, Ajman University, Ajman, United Arab Emirates); Abbas, Haidar (Salalah College of Applied Sciences, University of Technology and Applied Sciences, Salalah, Oman); Siddiqui, Muhammad Qutubuddin (College of Business Administration, Ajman University, Ajman, United Arab Emirates)","Sharma, Anshuman (Ajman University)","Sharma, Anshuman (Ajman University); Abbas, Haidar (Salalah College of Applied Sciences, University of Technology and Applied Sciences, Salalah, Oman); Siddiqui, Muhammad Qutubuddin (Ajman University)",15,15,0.23,7.84,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0249046&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137171662,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems",

Among the sub-Saharan African laboratories that have used SLIPTA, few have been francophone countries, and fewer have belonged to a military health system. The purpose of this article was to outline the strategy, implementation, outcomes and military-specific challenges of the HIA-CHU laboratory quality improvement programme from 2015 to 2018.
INTERVENTION: The strategy for the quality improvement programme included: external baseline SLIPTA evaluation, creation of work plan based on SLIPTA results, execution of improvement projects guided by work plan, assurance of accountability via regular meetings, training of personnel to improve personnel competencies, development of external stakeholder relationships for sustainability and external follow-up post-SLIPTA evaluation.
LESSONS LEARNT: Over a period of 3 years, the HIA-CHU laboratory improved its SLIPTA score by 29% through a quality improvement process guided by work plan implementation, quality management system documentation, introduction of new proficiency testing and internal quality control programmes, and enhancement of personnel competencies in technical and quality management through training.
RECOMMENDATIONS: The programme has yielded achievements, but consistent improvement efforts are necessary to address programme challenges and ensure continual increases in SLIPTA scores. Despite successes, military-specific challenges such as the high mobility of personnel have hindered programme progress. The authors recommend that further implementation research data be shared from programmes using SLIPTA in under-represented settings such as military health systems.",We hereby thank the United States Department of Defense HIV/AIDS Prevention Program for sponsoring the quality programme of the HIA-CHU laboratory.,,African Journal of Laboratory Medicine,,,,44238,2021,44238,,10,1,1057,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zohoun, Alban; Agbodand??, Tatiana B.; Kpad??, Ang??lique; Goga, Raliatou O.; Gainsi, Ren??; Bal??, Paul; Sambo, Bibata M.; Charlebois, Remi; Crane, Rachel; Merkel, Michele; Anani, Ludovic; Milgotina, Ekaterina","Zohoun, Alban (Department of Hematology, Faculty of Health Sciences, National University Hospital Center - Hubert Koutoukou Maga, Cotonou, Benin; Army Teaching Hospital, University Hospital Center, Cotonou, Benin); Agbodand??, Tatiana B.

In response to this unexpected situation, supply chain managers have decided to recover and reinforce their supply chains. Considering the expanse of these decisions, project management principle and tools seems inevitable to successfully manage the transformation from before pandemic to post-pandemic supply chains (SCs). In this study, the problem of timeÉ??cost tradeoff is extended to time, cost, and risk tradeoff. The risk factor is considered to convey the uncertainty arising from the COVID-19 pandemic situation. Since projects are affected by the level of pandemic expansion and different countries ruled out various quarantine policies (isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and lock-down), the tradeoff problem is influenced accordingly. Therefore, a scenario-based robust optimization model is proposed to deal with time, cost, and risk tradeoff problems to reflect the effects of the global pandemic of COVID-19 on managing projects in supply chains. In addition, various quarantine policies (isolation, quarantine, social distancing, and lock-down) as a prevalent response to the pandemic have been investigated separately. To illustrate the model, a real-world case study in the emerging economy of Iran is examined using the proposed approach.

We conducted a case-control study to assess factors associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission. The cases were PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 during June-September 2020. Controls lived at the same camp and were randomly selected from the workers who were PCR-negative for SARS-CoV-2. Data was collected telephonically by interviewing the oil workers. The study had 296 cases and 536 controls with 627 (75%) men, and 527 (63%) were below 40 years of age. Individual factors were the main drivers of transmission, with little contribution by environmental factors. Of the twenty individual factors, rare hand sanitizer use, travel before shift work, and social interactions outside of work increased SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Of the twenty-two environmental factors, only working in air-conditioned spaces was associated with SARS-CoV-2 transmission. Communication messages may enhance workers' individual responsibility and responsibility for the safety of others to reduce SARS-CoV-2 transmission.","The authors thank all responders for their participation in our study, TCO employees, the Department of Sanitary and Epidemiological Control of Atyrau region, Atyrau, Kazakhstan, and the MoH of the Republic of Kazakhstan for supporting the field investigation and providing surveillance data for this study.","Support for this project was provided by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Central Asia Field Epidemiology Training Program (CDC Cooperative Agreement GH15-1619) in Almaty, Kazakhstan.

Using Israel KirznerÉ??s insights from É??The Perils of Regulation,É?ù we argue that local, state, and federal COVID-19 policies have had and will continue to have long-run spillover effects and other negative unintended consequences. Pandemic policies have stifled entrepreneurial discovery and created opportunities for superfluous discovery, thus directing entrepreneurial efforts in directions that would not have existed otherwise. The normative implications of this analysis are that policymakers should better account for the wide variety of seen and unseen costs of policies that are likely to have many negative unintended consequences, regardless of the intentions behind such policies. One of the most effective ways to limit the perils of regulation is polycentric governance systems. With multiple, overlapping decision-making centers, polycentric systems allow for policymakers to experiment with different policy approaches and learn from other jurisdictions.

Correctly and objectively analyzing the causes of port hazardous chemical logistics safety accidents and the coupling mechanisms of risk generation are very important for reducing the occurrence of port hazardous chemical safety accidents. Based on the causal mechanism and coupling principle, in this paper, we construct a risk coupling system for port hazardous chemical logistics and analyze the coupling effects in the risk system. More specifically, a personnel-ship-environment-management system is established and the coupling between the four systems is explored. Taking Tianjin Port as an example, the risk coupling factors are analyzed in combination with system dynamics simulation. Under dynamic changes in coupling coefficients, the change of coupling effects are explored more intuitively, the logical relationships between logistics risks are analyzed and deduced, a comprehensive view of the coupling effects and their evolution process in accidents is provided, and the key causes of accidents and their coupling risk effects are identified. For port hazardous chemicals logistics safety accidents, the presented results not only allow for effective analysis of the causes of safety accidents, but also provide reference for the formulation of prevention strategies.",,This work was supported in part by the State Key Program of the National Social Science Foundation of China under Grant 19AGL030.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Hazardous Substances; Accidents; Transportation; Risk Factors,44980,2023,44980,,20,5,4008,All OA; Gold,Article,"Geng, Xiaoxiao; Lv, Yongwei; Zhao, Li; Wang, Yingchen","Geng, Xiaoxiao (Architecture and Art School, Hebei University of Engineering, Handan 056038, China); Lv, Yongwei (Management Engineering and Business School, Hebei University of Engineering, Handan 056038, China); Zhao, Li (Management Engineering and Business School, Hebei University of Engineering, Handan 056038, China); Wang, Yingchen (Management Engineering and Business School, Hebei University of Engineering, Handan 056038, China)","Zhao, Li (Hebei University of Engineering)","Geng, Xiaoxiao (Hebei University of Engineering); Lv, Yongwei (Hebei University of Engineering); Zhao, Li (Hebei University of Engineering); Wang, Yingchen (Hebei University of Engineering)",1,1,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/5/4008/pdf?version=1677227919,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155733753,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3505 Human Resources and Industrial Relations",3 Good Health and Well Being

A reason for this shortage may be the insufficient addressing of an ERP-specific interior boundary condition, i.e., the multi-stakeholder perspective, in explaining this phenomenon. This issue may entail a gap between how ERP success is supposed to occur and how ERP success may actually occur, leading to theoretical inconsistency when investigating its causal roots. Through a case-based, inductive approach, this manuscript presents an ERP success causal network that embeds the overlooked boundary condition and offers a theoretical explanation of why the most relevant observed causal relationships may occur.

A global turbulence such as the COVID-19 pandemic has had a strong impact on individual companies and entire economic sectors, raising the question of whether a paradigm shift is necessary, in order to enable a new cycle of development that is much environmentally, socially and economically sustainable. This environmental and socio-economic context of profound uncertainty forces organizations to consider more carefully the risk factors affecting their business continuity, as well as how these factors relate to sustainability issues. However, there is a gap in knowledge about how risk management systems relate to sustainability management systems, and how both of them exert influence on business performance, especially from a theoretical point of view. The aim of this study is to address this gap, by developing a new interpretative framework for the analysis of risk management strategies in organizations. This approach has been identified in economic hermeneutics as an innovative methodological tool to improve the knowledge of risk and design the most appropriate management strategies. The paper provides two main results: the first one is the construction of a theoretical model that relates risk management to sustainability management; the second one is an operational framework of multidimensional risk assessment useful for analysis at different levels (business, competitive scenario and system). Finally, the model also makes it possible to carry out a sustainability assessment through risk evaluation in the perspective of the sustainable development goals.","The authors thank the Editor, Guest Editors and anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on this paper.",,Global Journal of Flexible Systems Management,,,,44411,2021,44411,2021-12,22,Suppl 2,107-132,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Settembre-Blundo, Davide; Gonz?≠lez-S?≠nchez, Roc??o; Medina-Salgado, Sonia; Garc??a-Mui?Òa, Fernando E.","Settembre-Blundo, Davide (Department of Business Administration (ADO), Applied Economics II and Fundaments of Economic Analysis, Rey Juan-Carlos University, 28032, Madrid, Spain; Gruppo Ceramiche Gresmalt, Via Mosca 4, 41049, Sassuolo, Italy); Gonz?≠lez-S?≠nchez, Roc??o (Department of Business Administration (ADO), Applied Economics II and Fundaments of Economic Analysis, Rey Juan-Carlos University, 28032, Madrid, Spain); Medina-Salgado, Sonia (Department of Business Administration (ADO), Applied Economics II and Fundaments of Economic Analysis, Rey Juan-Carlos University, 28032, Madrid, Spain); Garc??a-Mui?Òa, Fernando E.

Information is shared to facilitate mutual business objectives. However, information sharing can also introduce security-related concerns that could expose the firm to a breach of privacy, with significant economic, reputational, and safety implications. It is imperative for organizations to leverage available information to evaluate security related to information sharing when evaluating current and potential information-sharing partnerships. The ""fine print"" or privacy policies of firms can provide a signal of security across a wide variety of firms being considered for new and continued information-sharing partnerships. In this article, we develop a methodology to gauge and benchmark information security policies in the partner-selection process that can help direct risk-based investments in information sharing security. We develop a methodology to collect and interpret firm privacy policies, evaluate characteristics of those policies by leveraging natural language processing metrics and developing benchmarking metrics, and understand how those characteristics relate to one another in information-sharing partnership situations. We demonstrate the methodology on 500 high-revenue firms. The methodology and managerial insights will be of interest to risk managers, information security professionals, and individuals forming information sharing agreements across industries.",ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank the two anonymous reviewers for their helpful and constructive feedback.,,Risk Analysis,,,,45312,2024,45312,45312,,,,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Yu, Wendy; Collier, Zachary A.; Thekdi, Shital","Yu, Wendy (Robins School of Business, University of Richmond, Richmond, Virginia, USA); Collier, Zachary A.

The development of pallet pooling is an essential component for the transformation and upgrade of the logistics industry in China. Pallet pooling can, however, lead to a conflict over potential benefits among the players. One of the main problems of pallet pooling in China is the reasonable benefit allocation mechanism has not been formed. The pallet pooling system (PPS) with participation of the third-party platform (PPSWPTPP) is one of the pilot modes of pallet pooling in China. Based on evolutionary game theory and a penalty mechanism for breach of contract, this paper constructs a tripartite evolutionary game model of the PPSWPTPP. Eight propositions are set in two basic scenarios regarding whether pallet pooling is adapted to the logistics market to study the stability and dynamic evolution process of the players in the PPSWPTPP. Theoretical and numerical simulation results indicate that these will affect the smooth development of the PPS. The suitable setting of penalties and bonuses, the precise estimation of the pooling benefits, the intention intensity of the players to the pallet pooling, and whether to adapt to the logistics market demand are explored.",This work was supported by a grant from the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (Grant no. 2020ZDPYMS29) awarded to QL.

Evidence from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hangzhou","This study explores how the perception of specific aspects of smart governance affects the business environment as to attract investment. To this end, we used a survey design and collected data from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Hangzhou. A total of 500 responses from different industries and companies were obtained and then empirically analyzed using ridge regression and intermediary effect models. We found that the perception of smart governance enhances investment due to strong governance and abundant business opportunities. Natural sustainability attracts investment directly because, when cities become smart, they tend to improve their sustainability and attract talent and capital inflows. This external participation has a direct impact on enterprise investment because it creates more business opportunities. An improved social credit system represents the comprehensive progress of the business environment and positively mediates smart governance and investment. This is the first study to combine the key elements of smart governance, the development stage of smart governance, and various dimensions of the business environment to analyze the influence of smart governance perceptions on commercial investments.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

This caused a series of interrelated consequences that not only prevent or slow down the spread of disease, but also impact the medical systems' capability to treat the patients and help their recovery. In particular, steeply growing demand for medical safety goods cannot be satisfied by regular suppliers due to the shortage of raw materials originating from other countries or remotely located national sources, under conditions of quarantined manpower. The current context inevitably brings back memories (and records!) of the situation 80 years ago, when WWII necessitated major effort directed at the rapid build-up of low-cost mass production to satisfy all aspects of war-time need. In the present short report we document a successful case of fast mass-production of light transparent medical safety face shields (thousands per day) realized in Skolkovo Institute of Science and Technology (Skoltech) at Fablab and Machine Shop Shared Facility (Skoltech FabLab). The demand for safety face shields by tens of hospitals in Moscow and other cities rapidly ramped up due to the need to protect medical staff during patient collection and transportation to hospitals, and within both the infected (""red"") and uninfected (""green"") zones. Materials selection for sterilizable transparent materials was conducted based on the analysis of merit indices, namely, minimal weight at given stiffness and minimal cost at given stiffness. Due to the need for permanent wear, design was motivated by low weight and comfortable head fixation, along with high production efficiency. The selection of minimal tooling in University fabrication workshops and the use of distributed volunteer labor are discussed.","Authors are grateful to the crew of FabLab of Skoltech for dedicated and sustained 3 shift work, to Skoltech senior management for providing funding and access permission; and to the courageous doctors, nurses and volunteers who were busy day and night rescuing patientsÉ?? lives, and nevertheless found time to advise our team.

The study aimed at establishing which factors which influenced their travel time, assessment of travel time, choosing more or less sustainable transport mode, and also single-mode or multimodal travel. Research results show that choice of the means of transport influences travel time, that the highest travel times are generated by bus and car travel and that assessing the travel time as acceptable or not depends on travel time. However, the longer the travel time, the more likely was the passenger to accept it.

The article evaluates and examines the market responses of companies in both countries, depending on their direct and indirect exposures to US-China trade. Moreover, this paper fills the gap in literature about deglobalization in Energy and Resources Sectors in Africa. This paper proves the idea that US companies that are more dependent on exports and imports from China have lower stock and bond returns, and, at the same time, higher default risks in the short time aspect. The article found Trade War effects in energy and resources companies in Africa in the last years: on ownership rank, on credit country rank, on default risks and on their profitability. The paper also demonstrates that companies' indirect exposure to US-China trade through domestic input-output links affects their responses to news on the subject matter. These findings suggest that the state of US-China trade of energy and resources is much more complex than the simplistic view of global trade that was in the beginning of Trade War with China. As a result of the Trade War, the real changes in stock prices of China companies (-0.07%) in energy and resource sectors is less than the same changes in US companies in Africa (-0.32%) in 2019. Also, the probability of default of Chinese companies (average default probability changed in -0.08%) in energy and resource sectors changed less than the same rank of US companies in Africa (average default probability changed by -0.84%).",,Jaehyung An was supported by Hankuk University of Foreign Studies Research Fund.,Heliyon,,,,44181,2020,44181,2020-12,6,12,e05693,All OA; Gold,Article,"An, Jaehyung; Mikhaylov, Alexey; Richter, Ulf H.","An, Jaehyung (College of Business, Hankuk University of Foreign Studies, Seoul, South Korea); Mikhaylov, Alexey (Financial University under the Government of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation); Richter, Ulf H.

After three Delphi rounds, consensus was obtained and the DfRP concept was defined as well as seven design principles, namely: (i) there must be functional models of the system; (ii) make variations in performance visible; (iii) use the type of standardization that best fits the nature of the function; (iv) design slack resources and strategies; (v) design for acceptable performance even under degraded conditions; (vi) design must involve leveraging diverse perspectives; and (vii) design to support continuous learning at the individual and organisational level. The applicability of the principles is demonstrated through an exploratory case study of the rapid response team in a hospital.

To identify critical issues and research gaps, our systematic literature review findings suggest that historic issues such as privacy, acceptance and security are increasingly replaced by operational considerations including interaction with and impacts on other airspace users. Recent incidents show that unrestricted drone use can inflict problems on other airspace users like airports and emergency services. Our review of current regulatory approaches shows a need for further policy and management response to both manage rapid and efficient drone usage growth, and facilitate innovation (e.g. intraurban package delivery), with one promising strategic response being low altitude airspace management (LAAM) systems for all drone use cases.",We acknowledge the contribution and comments received from participants at the 2019 Air Transport Research Society 23rd World Conference.

However, the current usage situation of single-use plastics including containers and packaging, which should be a basis of the strategy, is unclear. Here, we identify the nationwide material flow of plastics in Japan based on input-output tables. Of the domestic plastic demand of 8.4 Mt in 2015, 1.6 and 2.5 Mt were estimated to be for containers and packaging comprising household and industry inflows, respectively, through the purchase/procurement of products, services, and raw materials. Considering the current amount of recycling collected from households (1.0 Mt) and industries (0.3 to 0.4 Mt), the reuse/recycling target has already been achieved if the goal is limited to household container and packaging waste, as is the focus of Japan's recycling law. Conversely, the results indicate that it will be extremely difficult to reach the target collectively with industries. Therefore, it is essential that efforts be made throughout the entire supply chain. Food containers and packaging that flowed into the food-processing and food service sectors accounted for 15% of the inflow of containers and packaging into industries. Thus, the key to achieving the reuse/recycling target will comprise the collection of plastic food packaging from not only households but also the food industry. Furthermore, the collection of flexible plastic films used between industry sectors will put the target within reach.",We are grateful to the Japan Packaging Institute for providing production statistics and other useful information.

The researchers use a convenient sampling strategy and analyze the data using PLS-SEM modeling through Smart-PLS 4.0. The findings of this research demonstrate that subjective norms, religiosity, product attributes, brand trust, customer satisfaction, and lifestyle significantly and positively influence consumer purchase intention. The findings also show that consumer purchase intention, lifestyle, and subjective norms significantly and positively correlate with purchase behavior. Finally, the study concludes that purchase intention significantly and positively mediates between exogenous and endogenous variables (purchase behavior). This research has significant theoretical and managerial implications.

Recently, EBA has attracted much attention as a governance mechanism that may help to?ˇbridge the gap between principles and practice in AI ethics. However, important aspects of EBAÉ??such as the feasibility and effectiveness of different auditing proceduresÉ??have yet to be substantiated by empirical research. In this article, we address this knowledge gap by providing insights from a longitudinal industry case study. Over 12?ˇmonths, we observed and analysed the internal activities of AstraZeneca, a biopharmaceutical company, as it prepared for and underwent an ethics-based AI audit. While previous literature concerning EBA has focussed on proposing or analysing evaluation metrics or visualisation techniques, our findings suggest that the main difficulties large multinational organisations face when conducting EBA mirror classical governance challenges. These include ensuring harmonised standards across decentralised organisations, demarcating the scope of the audit, driving internal communication and change management, and measuring actual outcomes. The case study presented in this article contributes to the existing literature by providing a detailed description of the organisational context in which EBA procedures must be integrated to be feasible and effective.","The authors wish to thank Margi Sheth, Olawale Alimi, Mimmi Gersbro-Sundler, Peder Blomgren, Matthias Holweg, and Josh Cowls for helpful comments on earlier versions of this article.",JMÉ??s doctoral research at the Oxford Internet Institute is supported through a studentship provided by AstraZeneca.,AI and Ethics,,,,44712,2022,44712,2023-05,3,2,451-468,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"M??kander, Jakob; Floridi, Luciano","M??kander, Jakob (Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, 1 St GilesÉ??, OX1 3JS, Oxford, UK); Floridi, Luciano (Oxford Internet Institute, University of Oxford, 1 St GilesÉ??, OX1 3JS, Oxford, UK; Department of Legal Studies, University of Bologna, Via Zamboni 33, 40126, Bologna, Italy)","M??kander, Jakob (University of Oxford)","M??kander, Jakob (University of Oxford); Floridi, Luciano (University of Oxford; University of Bologna)",23,23,,24.17,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s43681-022-00171-7.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148299587,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

We find that exchange rate volatility and stock return volatilities are connected during pandemic-induced crises. The study also finds volatilities spillover among countries in the sample. Russia has strong volatility connectedness with India in these financial markets. The direction of volatility spillover is from Russia to India. Similarly, Brazil has strong volatility connectedness with South Africa and the direction volatility spillover is from Brazil to South Africa. Finally, China has a weak volatility connection with the remaining BRICS countries.

Owing to the interrelationships between multi-hazards and socio-economic dimensions, the impacts of these types of events can surmount those of multiple single hazards. The complexities involved in tackling multi-hazards and multi-risks hinder a more holistic and integrative perspective and make it difficult to identify overarching dimensions important for assessment and management purposes. We contribute to this discussion by building on systemic risk research, especially the focus on interconnectedness, and suggest ways forward for an integrated multi-hazard and multi-risk framework that should be beneficial in real-world applications.

Firstly, this work uses the mature Kealhofer, McQuown, and Vasicek (KMV) model to evaluate the default risk of corporate bonds. Secondly, Blockchain (BC) technology's Information Security (SEC) performance in default risk assessment is studied. Finally, it analyzes the default disposal mechanism of Chinese bond corporates. The Wind database is selected to verify the proposed model. The results show that the proposed BC-based corporate bond model for default risk assessment has a good fitting effect and can meet practical needs. The BC-based data encryption only needs 14.1?ˇms to obtain a key from an 821-bytes public key. The encryption time and decryption time of the Number Theory Research Unit (NTRU) system are 7.9?ˇms and 2.9?ˇms, respectively. Therefore, BC technology shows good performance in data encryption and can improve ISEC. According to the KMV model, corporate bonds have certain default risks. The Distance to Default (DtD) of corporate bonds is 20.8% lower than that of companies. Thus, corporates have higher default risk. Therefore, methods are needed to reduce the default risk and improve the earnings. The finding provides important technical support for effectively reducing the default risk of bond corporates in China and ensuring the healthy development of bond markets.",The authors acknowledge the help from the university colleagues.,This research received no external funding.,Operations Management Research,,,,44736,2022,44736,2022-12,15,45355,879-890,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Ta, Na; Gao, Bo","Ta, Na (School of Economics, Peking University, 100871, Beijing, China); Gao, Bo (School of Government and Public Affairs, Communication University of China, 100024, Beijing, China)","Gao, Bo (Communication University of China)","Ta, Na (Peking University); Gao, Bo (Communication University of China)",0,0,,0,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12063-022-00294-4.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148945692,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment",

Regardless the country or even the region, the negative consequences that are expected could be very big and the level of crisis is not predictable. This situation is the challenge for the real estate market as well. Due to this fact, the authors believe that there is the time when deep transformation of approaches, procedures and awareness related to valuation domain becomes. Today, due to the fact of the global COVID-19 and pandemic restrictions is the best time to implement the automated models and advanced technological solutions to the valuation world. The authors proposed the hybrid approach that is the way to reconcile the participants on the property market. Hybrid approach is understanding as the synergy in combining aspects of new (automated solutions) and traditional components that are developed in the agile mode system creation. The proposed solutions can be treated as a cure for some symptoms of the real estate market infection but also as a vaccine, which should to a large extent prevent restrictions and nuisance in real estate valuation in case of repeated infection.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors report no declarations of interest.,This work was supported by the National Science Centre [grant number 2019/33/B/HS4/00072],Land Use Policy,,,,44089,2020,44089,2020-12,99,,105070,All OA; Green,Article,"Renigier-Biè?ozor, Maè?gorzata; è?r??bek, Sabina; Walacik, Marek; Janowski, Artur","Renigier-Biè?ozor, Maè?gorzata (Department of Spatial Analysis and Real Estate Market, University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Poland.); è?r??bek, Sabina (Department of Spatial Analysis and Real Estate Market, University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Poland.); Walacik, Marek (Department of Spatial Analysis and Real Estate Market, University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Poland.); Janowski, Artur (Institute of Geodesy, University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, Poland.)","è?r??bek, Sabina (University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn)","Renigier-Biè?ozor, Maè?gorzata (University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn); è?r??bek, Sabina (University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn); Walacik, Marek (University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn); Janowski, Artur (University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn)",13,12,0.13,6.04,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7492006,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130862232,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3504 Commercial Services; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",

The empirical study shows that with the increase of GVCs position, EEE first increases and then decreases, showing an inverted U-shaped distribution. From the perspective of firm ownership, the relationship between GVCs position of domestic firms and EEE is inverted U-shaped distribution, while GVCs position of multinational enterprises (MNEs) is positively correlated with EEE. The relationship of capital-intensive and technology-intensive domestic firms, high-tech and medium-tech manufacturing domestic firms are also inverted U-shaped distribution. The positive correlation of MNEs is reflected in the low-tech manufacturing industries. From the perspective of trade patterns, with the increase of GVCs position, EEE of processing trade firms presents an inverted U-shaped distribution, while it is not significant for general trade firms. The inverted U-shaped relationship between GVCs position in capital-intensive industries and EEE are confirmed in all firms. Under anti-globalization scenarios of 50% backflow, EEE would increase. Under scenarios of 100% backflow, EEE would reduce. The results above provide useful references to achieve carbon emission reduction targets.","This study was supported by the Beijing Social Science Foundation (No. 17JDYJB010), Joint Development Program of Beijing Municipal Commission of Education and China Scholarship Council (201806030178), and Program of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences (2021YQNQD0063).",,The Science of The Total Environment,,,Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Commerce; Industry,44553,2021,44553,2022-03,813,,152587,Closed,Article,"Zheng, Lu; Zhao, Yuhuan; Shi, Qiaoling; Qian, Zhiling; Wang, Song; Zhu, Jingzhi","Zheng, Lu (School of Management and Economics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China.); Zhao, Yuhuan (School of Management and Economics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China; Sustainable Development Research Institute for Economy and Society of Beijing, Beijing 100081, China.

This research aims to explore the effects of country risks on the international tourism and the moderating role of informatization between the two. This study firstly measures country risks based on the ICRG database, quantifies international tourism by tourism revenue, tourism expenditure, and tourist arrival, and calculates informatization level from informatization facilities, informatization applications, and informatization skills. A dynamic SYS-GMM model is then adopted to verify the research hypotheses based on the panel data of 138 countries from 2000 to 2019. The research results show that the composite country risk, political risk, economic risk, and financial risk all show a negative impact on the international tourism indicators regardless of different time periods, regions, or income levels. However, the effects are more obvious before the global financial crisis in 2008 and regions and countries with lower income levels. In addition, informatization is found to positively mitigate the adverse impacts of country risks on international tourism, especially for economic and financial risks. The research findings indicate the risk hedge potential of informatization in the tourism industry, which provides a profound reference for destination risk management.",,"This work was supported by China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2019M660783, to Zhaoming Deng), China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2018M641457, to Fuyuan Wang) and National Natural Science Foundation of China (41901181, to Fuyuan Wang).

This is further exacerbated by land use transformations, urbanization, over-tourism, sociopolitical tensions, technological innovations, among others. A scenario-informed multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) was applied in the Metropolitan City of Venice integrating qualitative (i.e., local stakeholder preferences) and quantitative information (i.e., climate-change projections) with the aim of enhancing system resilience to multiple climate-related threats. As part of this analysis, different groups of local stakeholders (e.g., local authorities, civil protection agencies, SMEs, NGOs) were asked to identify critical functions that needs to be sustained. Various policy initiatives were considered to support these critical functions. The MCDA was used to rank the initiatives across several scenarios describing main climate threats (e.g., storm surges, floods, heatwaves, drought). We found that many climate change scenarios were considered to be disruptive to stakeholders and influence alternative ranking. The management alternatives acting on physical domain generally enhance resilience across just a few scenarios while cognitive and informative initiatives provided resilience enhancement across most scenarios considered. With uncertainty of multiple stressors along with projected climate variability, a portfolio of cognitive and physical initiatives is recommended to enhance resilience.","The research leading to these results has received funding from the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation in the frame of the Project BRIDGEÉ??Building resilience of society to disasters: improved methodologies and solutions for Italy and USA (2019É??2021).

However, limited access to data on firm-level digital intensity is an impediment to advancement of multiple research projects concerned with firm digitalization. To alleviate this challenge, this paper proposes a method for estimating firm-level digital intensity based on other more readily available firm-level data and reference data on digitalization, which is available on sector-level. The proposed method utilizes firm-level revenue breakdown by sector to estimate sector revenue-weighted digital intensity scores, which lead to classification of firms into low, medium and high digital intensity groups. The output from the proposed method can be directly used in research concerned with firm digitalization and investigating this multifaceted phenomenon. Results from the application of the proposed method to an illustrative sample of large US and non-US firms (2000 observations in total) indicate that firm-level digital intensity can be efficiently estimated for large samples using data commonly available to researchers. The key differences between the proposed method and alternative methods are:É?õRecognition of the fact that firms might participate in more than one sector or industry, which partially explains within-sector heterogeneity in firm-level digital intensity. We found that 67.8% of large US firms and 78.6% of large non-US firms were engaged in more than one industry.É?õUse of reference sector-level digital intensity scores, which allows for rapid update, application across geographies and time, as well as parallel calculation of multiple digital intensity scores for each reference data. Furthermore, use of reference data enables supplementation of firm-level data on digitalization.É?õReplicability of the method and reproducibility of the results through inclusion of the source code and availability of data through research and commercial databases.","We would like to thank research director Jyrki Ali-Yrkk?? from the Research Institute of the Finnish Economy (ETLA) for providing feedback on an earlier version of this method.

Based on the influenced mechanism of the VAT input refund and the tax burden effect (and the price effect) caused by the VAT rate, enterprises' intertemporal optimal asset allocation models are constructed under the states of adopting the VAT input refund and maintaining the theoretical tax (non-)neutrality of VAT. When VAT rates of the general taxpayers are predicted to be reduced, we also use China's manufacturing and economic data to simulate specific cases to verify propositions under different states. The results show that: (1) When the VAT output tax rate decreases: if returns to scale are diminishing, enterprises will increase the number of productive material assets and labor and reduce financial assets. (2) When the VAT input tax rate reduces: under the state of adopting the VAT input refund and maintaining the theoretical tax (non-)neutrality of VAT, if returns to scale are decreasing, enterprises will reduce the number of productive material assets and labor and increase financial assets. Under the state of adopting the VAT input refund and maintaining the theoretical tax neutrality of VAT, if returns to scale are increasing and the expected rate of return of financial assets is lower than the additional tax rate, or the enterprise has diminishing returns to scale and the expected rate of return of financial assets is higher than the additional tax rate, enterprises will increase the number of productive material assets and labor. (3) When VAT output and input tax rates reduce simultaneously: under the state of adopting the VAT input refund and maintaining the theoretical tax neutrality of VAT, if returns to scale are increasing and the expected return rate of financial assets is higher than the additional tax rate, the enterprise will reduce the number of productive material assets and labor and increase financial assets. Under the diminishing returns to scale in China's national economy, the research conclusions endorse the rational necessity of the VAT policy change-VAT rate reduction to develop the entity economy and provide a reference for enterprises to make asset allocation decisions.

What is reactive hazard? What is biohazard? Chemical or biotransformation means change. Any changes have irreversible consequences. Managing the changes can help us, while changes can also be harmful. The first-line of defense on any potential unwanted transformations is isolation or containment. WHO defines four-risk groups of biosafety levels. There are six key knowledge bases for biosafety. With chemical safety, substance identification is the first step. The global harmonized system (GHS) of classification and labeling is generally agreed by the world bodies. The hazards are divided into three categoriesÉ??physical, health, and environmental hazards. Chemical reactivity hazard is a situation where an uncontrolled reaction could result directly or indirectly in serious harm to people, property, or equipment. Fire and explosion are common reactivity hazards. To safe guard processes and facility, one needs to first identify the threat, or screening for reactivity hazards. Combustion processes proceed with chain reactions and the reaction is highly exothermic. Combined with the high-activation energy, combustion leads to large-temperature dependence. The overall reaction products can also vary (partial oxidation versus total oxidation). Partial oxidation reactions are important in chemical industry. Pyrolysis and gasification of biomass, for example, are useful technologies in biomass conversion. An explosion is a fast, transient, exothermic reaction. Unintended and accidental explosions can occur due to (1) The accumulation of reactive chemicals (gas, liquid, or solid) in confined space; (2) Leakage of É??significant amountÉ?ù of reactive chemicals (gas, liquid, or solid) to atmosphere or environment; or (3) Reactor runaway.

This study examines the direct and indirect impacts of internal and external corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices on employee job satisfaction through organisational identification, conditional on employee age. A total of 236 valid responses were received from eight multinational medical device manufacturers in Malaysia. Partial least squares and PROCESS algorithms were employed to assess the hypothesised interactions between the predictors and criterion variables. The empirical results showed that internal CSR (i.e., CSR to employee) could significantly drive a greater sense of belonging and work satisfaction. Surprisingly, however, external CSR (i.e., CSR to community) negatively affects job fulfilment in the medical devices industry during the pandemic. Nevertheless, the findings also showed that ongoing CSR activities in the community could build organisational identification and subsequently improve job satisfaction. Conversely, CSR to environment did not statistically influence job satisfaction, either directly or indirectly. The mediating effects of organisational identification were not associated with employee age. This study provides a practical framework for effective CSR strategies amid the pandemic that can help organisations align with social responsibility, enhance their reputation, and contribute to society.",,,European Management Journal,,,,45024,2023,45024,2023-04,,,,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Cheah, Jeffrey S S; Lim, Kok-Hooi","Cheah, Jeffrey S S (Graduate School of Business, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 11800, USM, Penang, Malaysia.); Lim, Kok-Hooi (Graduate School of Business, Universiti Sains Malaysia, 11800, USM, Penang, Malaysia.)","Cheah, Jeffrey S S (Universiti Sains Malaysia)","Cheah, Jeffrey S S (Universiti Sains Malaysia); Lim, Kok-Hooi (Universiti Sains Malaysia)",3,3,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.emj.2023.04.003,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157105712,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

China has always focused on peaceful diplomacy, and the world market has a strong demand for Chinese products. This work aims to improve the accuracy of exchange rate forecasting. The risk factors that may be encountered in the investment process of multinational enterprises can be effectively avoided. Combining the advantages of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), the LSTM-CNN (Long Short-Term Memory-Convolutional Neural Network) model is proposed to predict the volatility trend of stocks. Firstly, the investment risk of multinational enterprises is analyzed, and, secondly, the principles of the used CNN and LSTM are expounded. Finally, the performance of the proposed model is verified by setting experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that when predicting the 10 selected stocks, the proposed LSTM-CNN model has the highest accuracy in predicting the volatility of stocks, with an average accuracy of 60.1%, while the average accuracy of the rest of the models is all below 60%. It can be found that the stock category does not have a great impact on the prediction accuracy of the model. The average prediction accuracy of the CNN model is 0.578, which is lower than that of the Convolutional Neural Network-Relevance model, and the prediction accuracy of the LSTM model is 0.592, which is better than that of the Long Short-Term Memory-Relevance model. The designed model can be used to predict the stock market to guide investors to make effective investments and reduce investment risks based on relevant cases.

These models are known to be numerically challenging to various degrees, depending on the choice of the f-divergence function. The numerical challenges are even more pronounced under mixed-integer first-stage decisions. In this paper, we propose novel divergence functions that produce practicable robust counterparts, while maintaining versatility in modeling diverse ambiguity aversions. Our functions yield robust counterparts that have comparable numerical difficulties to their nominal problems. We also propose ways to use our divergences to mimic existing f-divergences without affecting the practicability. We implement our models in a realistic location-allocation model for humanitarian operations in Brazil. Our humanitarian model optimizes an effectiveness-equity trade-off, defined with a new utility function and a Gini mean difference coefficient. With the case study, we showcase (1) the significant improvement in practicability of the robust stochastic optimization counterparts with our proposed divergence functions compared to existing f-divergences, (2) the greater equity of humanitarian response that the objective function enforces and (3) the greater robustness to variations in probability estimations of the resulting plans when ambiguity is considered.",,,OR Spectrum,,,,45067,2023,45067,2023-09,45,3,759-806,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Caunhye, Aakil M.; Alem, Douglas","Caunhye, Aakil M.

Today, the Blockchain can play a pivotal role to re-establish pre-pandemic standards and enhance the development of global philanthropy. However, it is still too little considered due to the criticalities encountered during the launch and development of the initiatives as well as for a general incomprehension of its technology. Therefore, this work aims to demonstrate the Blockchain impact on the development of charity 4.0, especially in an extremely dramatic historical moment marked by the Covid-19 pandemic. The objective is achieved through the case study of Charity Wall, an emerging Italian social marketplace appreciated by important business associations for its innovative solutions in the charity 4.0 sector and for the important support provided to NPOs during their traditional function as well as against Covid-19 in Italy. Through a benchmark analysis, this work succeeds in highlighting the innovative solutions proposed by Charity Wall compared to the charity 4.0 systems on the market. More specifically, through the Charity Wall case study it is possible to demonstrate which aspects of Blockchain technology can be used to strengthen the philanthropic system by avoiding cases of fraud to the detriment of beneficiaries, receivers and donors as well as to create a closer network between the various philanthropic players to support charitable initiatives against the Covid-19.",,Open access funding provided by Universit?ˇ degli Studi G.

This paper focuses on conceptual tools to improve our understanding of these crises as well as the facilitating factors and barriers for sustainability governance to play a role in transitioning to profoundly more sustainable societies than those that currently exist. Bioenergy is used throughout the paper as an example to aid contextually in understanding the theoretical and abstract arguments. We first define eight premises upon which our argumentation is developed. We then define sustainability, sustainability transition, legitimacy, and trust as a premise for obtaining effectiveness in communication and minimising risks associated with misunderstanding key terms. We proceed to examine the literature on É??good governanceÉ?ù in order to reflect upon what defines ""good sustainability governance"" and what makes governance systems successful in achieving their goals. We propose input, output, and throughput legitimacy as three principles constituting É??goodÉ?ù sustainability governance and propose associated open-ended criteria as a basis for developing operational standards for assessing the quality of a sustainability governance system or complex.?ˇAs sustainability governance systems must develop to remain relevant, we also suggest an adaptive governance model, where continuous re-evaluation of the sustainability governance system design supports the system in remaining É??goodÉ?ù in conditions that are complex and dynamic. Finally, we pull from the literature in a broad range of sciences to propose a conceptual É??governance research frameworkÉ?ù that aims to facilitate an integrated understanding of how the design of sustainability governance systems influences the legitimacy and trust granted to them by relevant actors. The framework is intended to enhance the adaptive features of sustainability governance systems so as to allow the identification of the causes of existing and emerging sustainability governance crises and finding solutions to them. Knowledge generated from its use may form a basis for providing policy recommendations on how to practically solve complex legitimacy and trust crises related to sustainability governance.","The authors would like to thank IEA Bioenergy, also known as the Technology Collaboration Programme (TCP) for a Programme of Research, Development and Demonstration on Bioenergy, for funding under the IEA Bioenergy inter-Task project É??Measuring, governing and gaining support for sustainable bioenergy supply chainsÉ?ù.

Hence, collaboration among these actors is necessary to prepare for, respond to, and recover from such events. This seldom occurs in an effective or efficient manner, however. Drawing on resource dependence theory and the concept of social capital, this paper reveals that different types of collaborative relationships exist within the collaborative network. Super Ministry Reform of Emergency Management in China serves as a case in point. By evaluating network efficiency and classifying the collaborative relationships of involved government agencies, four types are identified: resource-redundant; resource-complementary; resource-dependent; and resource-isolated. The different influences of collaborative relationships explain why the reform is not that effective, although it has led to the merger of several core departments in the emergency management network.

The existing policy and regulatory frameworks for mitigating cyberfraud in South African banks are not holistic, thus, the purpose of this study is to develop a holistic policy and regulatory framework that integrates the legal, governance, internal control and supervisory frameworks for cyberfraud mitigation in the South African banking industry.
Method: ology: The study employs a mixed method comprising of both qualitative and quantitative approaches. A structured questionnaire was developed and made available to selected members of staff of the 17 licensed banks in South Africa. These experts deal directly with the banking operations, administration and customers' services. Non-parametric statistical analysis, specifically the Chi-square, Fischer's Exact, Spearman's correlation and cross tabulation statistics, were employed for the statistical analysis of the data gathered from the survey. From the outcome of the survey, a simplified policy and regulatory framework was developed for the mitigation of the effects of cyberfraud in order to enhance the performance of South African banks.
Findings: The outcome of the survey indicated that there is a relationship between the methods of cyberfraud identification and the occurrence of cyberfraud in the South African banking industry. Furthermore, the methods of cyberfraud identification were presumed to be effective based on the evidence presented in this study. Despite this, the effect of cyberfraud perpetration was still found to be detrimental to the South African banks.
Practical implications: This study presents a simplified and executable policy as well as regulatory framework for mitigating cyberfaud in South African banks. The proposed policies and regulations are geared towards improving cyber resilience and minimising the effects of cyberfraud occurrences.
Novelty: Existing works have not sufficiently reported on the integrated policy and regulatory framework for mitigating cyberfraud. Thus, this study developed a simplified integrated policy and regulatory framework for mitigating cyberfraud to enhance the performance of South African banks in the area of cyberfraud mitigation.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

ESG would receive more attention from the industry and academia in a global environment full of uncertainties. Companies benefit from the sharing of ESG data by improving their brand image, which attracts funding, lowers financing costs, and increases valuation.
PURPOSE: To explore how ESG drives corporate financial performance. Also, the research examines the interrelation of ESG presentation and corporate presentation.
DESIGN: /methodology/approach: Over an interval of 10 years (2011-2020) using a sample of 3332 listed organizations worldwide. The theory of the research is on the basis of stakeholder and transmitting signal theory and multiple regression and categorized regression were applied with STATA 16.0 software.
RESULTS: The study utilizes a large dataset of 24,076 valid observations, providing robust statistical power for the analysis. The study findings proved that ESG performance is positively interrelated with corporate performance (p?ˇ<?ˇ0.01). According to the findings of the study, at 1% of the level related to significance (p?ˇ<?ˇ0.01), the regression coefficient for ESG is considerably positive. Thus, the influence of ESG rating on corporate performance is significant for large-scale companies and insignificant for small-scale companies. The results demonstrate that the positive impact of ESG rating on corporate financial performance is more pronounced in the high risk case than in the low risk case (p?ˇ<?ˇ0.01). The results highlight the importance of ESG performance in today's world. Overall, the study gives precious perception about the interrelation between ESG and corporate financial performance (CFP).
POLICY IMPLICATIONS: The researchers believe that the results of this study are beneficial to companies and governments in the development of environmentally conscious industries since they demonstrate corporate success through ESG. More realistically, the ESG can boost corporate firm performance by enabling businesses to maintain sustainability, establish a solid reputation, win the trust of stakeholders, and contribute to solving national sustainable development issues. Additionally, the researchers believe that the results of this study can boost management effectiveness, which in turn can help firms succeed.
ORIGINALITY/VALUE: In the context of environmentally sensitive industries, this study findings provide empirical insights to the association between the corporate firms success and ESG performance. In addition, the findings provide insights to the business organizations development and the significance of ESG integration in the business organizations.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,This study did not receive any funding in any form.,Journal of Environmental Management,,,Carbon; Commerce; Government; Industry; Investments,45177,2023,45177,2023-11,345,,118829,Closed,Article,"Chen, Simin; Song, Yu; Gao, Peng","Chen, Simin (School of Business, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, 999078, China.); Song, Yu (School of Business, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, 999078, China.

This study examines the effect of EID on corporate environmental performance (EP) and financial performance (FP) using a two-way fixed-effect model. For this purpose, this study considers the panel data of 1125 Chinese A-share listed companies from 2009 to 2021. Additionally, we explore the underlying mechanisms using mediation models. The results reveal that EID can significantly improve corporate performance through green innovation (GI). Moreover, EID can enhance corporate GI, which improves the financial performance of high-polluting firms and the environmental performance of non-high-polluting firms. According to these results, it is imperative to continuously improve corporate EID systems and encourage GI in enterprises. Thus, firms should take the initiative to disclose environmental information. There is a pressing need to enhance the effectiveness of the capital market, therefore, firms with higher levels of EID and better environmental performance can gain greater benefits.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

We analyze businessesÉ?? responses to the first and very stringent lockdown in March 2020 by making use of monthly administrative data and taking value-added tax payment changes as a proxy for the demand shock. We exploit variation in the sectoral differences across small, medium, and large firms. A simple average employment adjustment was non-negative in agriculture, construction, information and communication, and public administration sectors in our sample. By merging data with COVID-19 tests, classified by economic activity, and employing a fixed-effects instrumental variable regression, we find that all sized firms in the manufacturing sector reduced employment more if they had uncovered tax liabilities before the lockdown. Among small firms, real estate and service sector firms downsized more rapidly. While employment changes are rather modest, this very early evidence about businessesÉ?? reactions to COVID-19-induced uncertainty and activity restrictions points to the need to address business liquidity needs early on. Another policy message concerns the importance of firm pre-conditions among capital-intensive and services firms and, in particular, small businesses to avoid subsequent employment losses.","I thank the Editor, Roy Thurik, and two anonymous referees for helpful and constructive comments as well as Yifei Zhang for advice during the remote workshp.",,Small Business Economics,,,,44350,2021,44350,2022-02,58,2,919-942,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Lastauskas, Povilas","Lastauskas, Povilas (Center for Excellence in Finance and Economic Research and Faculty of Economics and Business Administration, Bank of Lithuania and Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania)","Lastauskas, Povilas (Bank of Lithuania; Vilnius University)","Lastauskas, Povilas (Bank of Lithuania; Vilnius University)",9,8,,5.83,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11187-021-00496-3.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138578241,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 38 Economics",8 Decent Work and Economic Growth

This often creates local disconnectedness that energizes the current populist backlash against MNE activities. We develop approaches to new IB theory, addressing the interdependencies of MNEs and city-regions that we propose as a crucial avenue for future research. We contrast two generic MNE strategies. The first is the traditional one: the É??global orchestrationÉ?? of resources and markets. We argue that it exacerbates local disconnectedness. The second, that we call É??local spawning,É?? involves engaging with the local entrepreneurial eco-system to create and renew local connectedness, diffusing populist responses. Some MNEs are better able to implement a local spawning strategy, due to industry factors like innovation clock-speed, and firm characteristics like organizational path dependency. Finally, we distinguish between disconnection, which is an outcome of MNE strategy, and global disruptions, like the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, which are primarily stochastic events. Addressing disconnections requires MNEs to re-orient their strategies while dealing with disruptions requires undertaking risk mitigation. We present empirical evidence from city-regions around the world to illustrate our theory.","We would like to acknowledge the excellent research assistance of Thomas J.

Because of this vulnerability, as evidenced by the COVID-19 pandemic, the study of hotel resilience is a key issue for the survival and competitiveness of organisations and destinations. Therefore, this paper proposes a holistic model to measure organisational resilience. To that end, it aims to analyse the determinants of organisational resilience, i.e. predictors of resilience (strategy and change), and to assess how they contribute to hotel resilience and performance. Firstly, the hotel context in the Canary Islands is examined to identify the level of impact, frequency and predictability of each type of change. Secondly, scales development and validation were conducted. Finally, the proposed model is validated.

Metro-based underground logistics system (M-ULS) may be an innovative approach to deal with this city-level disaster due to its efficient operation, contactless and driverless characteristics. However, the market evolution process and the quantitative calculation framework of comprehensive benefits after the application of M-ULS are still unclear, which has become a problem of mutual restriction with the extensive application of M-ULS. This paper attempts to use the system dynamics method, based on the real-world simulation, to analyze the quantitative relationship between the M-ULS implementation and the city logistics performance under epidemic outbreaks. Wuhan city in China was selected as the empirical background, and five simulation scenarios were set under different implementation strategies of M-ULS in response to the epidemic. Six variables were selected to measure city logistics performance and M-ULS operation status, including demand fill-rate, unit delivery time, total deprivation cost, total transportation cost, total number of susceptible people, and utilization rate of M-ULS. The results show that M-ULS is effective in improving the performance of city logistics and responding to the epidemic. The delivery time and transportation cost have a strong impact on the market share of M-ULS. Finally, a set of incentive policies was designed to promote the adoption of M-ULS. The findings not only provide a method for evaluating the overall performance of M-ULS, but also provide a unique perspective for promoting the implementation of M-ULS and responding to the transportation challenges brought by the epidemic.","This work is financially supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants 71631007,71971214, 52078481).",,Transport Policy,,,,44499,2021,44499,2022-02,116,,81-95,All OA; Green,Article,"Xu, Yuanxian; Dong, Jianjun; Ren, Rui; Yang, Kai; Chen, Zhilong","Xu, Yuanxian (School of Defense Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, 210007, China.); Dong, Jianjun (School of Civil Engineering, Nanjing Tech University, Nanjing, 211816, China.); Ren, Rui (School of Defense Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, 210007, China.); Yang, Kai (State Key Laboratory of Rail Traffic Control and Safety, Beijing Jiaotong University, Beijing, 100044, China.); Chen, Zhilong (School of Defense Engineering, Army Engineering University of PLA, Nanjing, 210007, China.)","Dong, Jianjun (Nanjing Tech University)","Xu, Yuanxian (PLA Army Engineering University); Dong, Jianjun (Nanjing Tech University); Ren, Rui (PLA Army Engineering University); Yang, Kai (Beijing Jiaotong University); Chen, Zhilong (PLA Army Engineering University)",20,19,,9.3,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8556189,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142251387,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

Resilience engineering approach is identified as a complementary to conventional safety management techniques. Resilience of safety management systems is characterized by the capabilities to recover from, respond during, and prepare for unexpected situations. This research aims to conceptualize resilience of safety management systems in the building repair and maintenance context by introducing resilience engineering principles into the safety management system concept.
METHOD: Data were collected from 145 professionals in building repair and maintenance companies in Australia. The structural equation modeling technique was utilized to analyze the collected data.
RESULTS: The results confirmed three dimensions (i.e., people resilience, place resilience, and system resilience) with 32 measurement items for assessing resilience of safety management systems. The results revealed that safety performance of building R&M companies was significantly affected by the interactions between people resilience and place resilience and the interactions between place resilience and system resilience.
CONCLUSIONS: Theoretically, this study contributes to the safety management knowledge by theoretically and empirically supporting the development of concept, definition, and purpose of resilience for safety management systems.
PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS: Practically, this research proposes a framework for assessing the level of resilience of safety management systems that is characterized by employees' capabilities, supportiveness of workplace, and supportiveness of management to recover from safety incidents, react during unexpected situations, and prepare for preventative actions before occurrence of undesirable events.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.

Cooperatives are hybrid organizations that maximize value, instead of profit. They are owned, governed, and controlled by their members. They are more resilient than the conventional enterprises in times of crisis, thanks to their peculiar governance characteristics that ensure member centrality. Next to member centrality, the embeddedness of cooperatives in their local environment and a global movement enhances mission centrality as well as trust and solidarity among their members, local communities, and other cooperatives.","This research was partially funded by KU Leuven C2É?êproject (C24/18/004) and by the Research Foundation Flanders (FWOÉ??SBO project S006019N, SBÉ?êfellowship Adrien Billet).","Funding information FWOÉ??SBO project, Grant/Award Number: S006019N; FWOÉ??SB Fellowship Adrien Billiet, Grant/Award Number: 1S95420N; KU Leuven C2É?êproject, Grant/Award Number: C24/18/004",Strategic Change,,,,44265,2021,44265,2021-03,30,2,99-108,All OA; Green,Article,"Billiet, Adrien; Dufays, Fr??d??ric; Friedel, Stefanie; Staessens, Matthias","Billiet, Adrien (Faculty of Economics and Business, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium); Dufays, Fr??d??ric (Faculty of Economics and Business, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium); Friedel, Stefanie (Faculty of Economics and Business, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium); Staessens, Matthias (Faculty of Economics and Business, KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium)","Dufays, Fr??d??ric (KU Leuven)","Billiet, Adrien (KU Leuven); Dufays, Fr??d??ric (KU Leuven); Friedel, Stefanie (KU Leuven); Staessens, Matthias (KU Leuven)",57,51,,36.96,https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/123456789/671066/2/Billiet%20et%20al%20%28in%20press%29%20-%20Resilience%20of%20coops%20Covid-19%20-%20Pre-print%20version.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1136265180,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 44 Human Society",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

United Nations general assembly has recommended increasing energy efficiency by considering the SDG-7 guidelines. In the contemporary period, E7 economies are deficient in producing the financial resources to ensure the availability of funds for the acquisition of energy efficiency. COVID-19 crises, lack of resilience in economies, devastating fiscal burdens, and tight monetary conditions of E7 economies are the major barriers. To resolve such issues, some innovative financing techniques, such as green financing, financial inclusion, and FinTech, were suggested to investigate. However, this research tested the empirical role of financial inclusion, green financing, and FinTech on the energy efficiency of E7 economies. Study findings have shown a significant role of such financing techniques on energy efficiency. Comparatively, green financing is found most fitting and highly supportive financing tool for energy efficiency among the three. The differences in attributes, financing mechanism, funds flow system, transection systems, and variation in support by the financial institution are the main reasons that lessen the role of financial inclusion and FinTech for energy efficiency. However, theorists must revisit the transaction system of FinTech and financial inclusion parameters like green bonds for energy efficiency attainment.

Evidence from manufacturing sector in China,"Environmental governance has emerged as a crucial tactic to support the sustainable development of human civilization in light of the serious environmental issues. Meanwhile, during the process of promoting the high-quality development of ChinaÉ??s economy, digital transformation plays a significant role in improving the total factor productivity of the manufacturing sector. We seek to find out whether urban environmental governance has an impact on micro-enterprises, and therefore, the study selects the data of A-share listed manufacturing companies from 2012 to 2020 to study the effect of digital transformation on the total factor productivity of the manufacturing industry and how the effect of environmental governance affects the relationship between digital transformation and total factor productivity. The results unveil that digital transformation can significantly contribute to the total factor productivity of the manufacturing industry. At the same time, digital transformation can promote the high-quality development of enterprises by promoting the fulfillment of corporate social responsibility. Additionally, it is shown that poor environmental governance will weaken the promoting effect of digital transformation on total factor productivity. Furthermore, in state-owned companies and non-heavy polluting industries, environmental governance has a more significant moderating influence on digital transformation and total factor productivity. This study enriches the literature on urban environmental governance and micro-enterprise development, and they support the notion that, from the standpoints of environmental protection and economic development, the level of environmental governance should be continuously optimized and the development of ecological civilization should be strengthened.",,"This research was funded by the National Social Science Fund General Project of China (22BJL047), the Key Project of Philosophy and Social Science Research in Colleges and Universities in Jiangsu Province (2021SJZDA121), the National Social Science Fund Project of Jiangsu Province (21GLB001), and the China Institute of Manufacturing Development Open Project, É??Research on industrial intelligence of furniture manufacturing industry.É?ù",Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,Humans; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Policy; Commerce; Manufacturing Industry; China; Economic Development,45154,2023,45154,2023-09,30,43,97005-97024,Closed,Article,"Sun, Wei; Fang, Jiahui","Sun, Wei (Business School, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China; China Institute of Manufacturing Development, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China); Fang, Jiahui (Business School, Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Nanjing, China)","Fang, Jiahui (Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology)","Sun, Wei (Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology; Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology); Fang, Jiahui (Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology)",3,3,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163322470,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour","8 Decent Work and Economic Growth; 9 Industry, Innovation and Infrastructure"

In this regard, we used the É??bootstrap autoregressive distributed lag modelÉ?ù to explore the impact of clean energy and oil prices on the intensity of carbon emissions in ChinaÉ??s transportation sector. The study found that an increase in oil prices decreases the intensity of carbon emissions in the short and long run. Similarly, an increase in the level of renewable energy and economic complexity declines the intensity of carbon emissions in the transportation sector. On the contrary, the research demonstrates that non-renewable energy contributes positively to carbon emission intensity. Therefore, the authorities must promote green technology to neutralize the transportation systemÉ??s detrimental effects on ChinaÉ??s environmental quality.

This article seeks to understand how mining firms have reshaped their strategies to ensure financial sustainability while also meeting external expectations of increasing shared-value outcomes by assessing how firms are deploying buffers and bridges. Firms use buffers when they seek to protect core business activities from supply-side and demand-side volatilities by shifting their overall business strategy and bridges to conform with external expectations of improving shared-value outcomes. The article constructs a case study using five sets of data to assess (i) what supply and demand shocks firms are facing; (ii) how they are reshaping their strategies and undertaking activities to protect the firm from these shocks; (iii) what challenges firms face with reaching shared-value outcomes; and (iv) how firms are undertaking activities to improve shared-value outcomes. This article finds that although buffering activities have been successful at increasing the financial sustainability of mining activities, bridging activities have been less successful given that royalties are vulnerable to maladministration, the impact of corporate social investments often short-lived, and insular and local procurement is limited to low-value-added activities, particularly in the context of mechanization.

The European emissions trading system has been the most ambitious management of negative externalities related to GHG set-up at the international level. The EU now considers that the costs of ecological industrial transition could limit the ability of European industries to compete in the globalized market with industries not subject to similar limits and costs. The EU intends to adopt a carbon adjustment tax at the border, to limit the phenomenon of reallocation and compensate for environmental costs.

Two steps estimation was used to run the data, using the Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) model to determine the company's TE and panel data to test the effect of TE through firm value. The results show that Indonesia has the highest score for TE (62%), followed by Pakistan (59%), South Africa (57%), Malaysia (55%), and Singapore (52%), which means, in general, there is inefficiency in allocating resources over 38% up to 48% and needs to be improved by halal food and beverage companies in. Regarding panel data, all countries sample except Pakistan highlight that TE significantly affect company value. It indicates that the crucial part of managing efficiency can be a sign in stock market performance. The result shows that company managers should set efficiency strategies to their business process for creating sustainability and increase their value in the capital market.

Our research is motivated by mixed empirical evidence on the performance of BG-affiliated firms. Using return on equity as a measure of operating performance and a sample of Indian firms, we first show that BG firms have lower ROE than stand-alone firms, on average. We disaggregate ROE into operating profitability (return on net operating assets É?? RNOA) and financial policy decisions (net borrowing costs É?? NBC and financial leverage É?? FFLEV) and show that while BG firms do not experience a significant change in NBC and FLLEV during the pandemic compared to stand-alone firms, relative to pre-COVID times, they experience a significant drop in RNOA. This is driven by much lower sales during the pandemic. Further, the relative decline in BG performance during the pandemic is driven by firms affiliated with smaller BGs, younger BGs, and less diversified BGs.",Declaration of Competing Interest We declare that we have contributed equally to the project.,,Pacific-Basin Finance Journal,,,,45031,2023,45031,2023-06,79,,102031,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Banerjee, Pradip; Dhole, Sandip; Mishra, Sagarika","Banerjee, Pradip (Indian Institute of Management, Indore, India); Dhole, Sandip (Monash University, Melbourne, Australia); Mishra, Sagarika (Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia)","Mishra, Sagarika (Deakin University)","Banerjee, Pradip (Indian Institute of Management Indore); Dhole, Sandip (Monash University); Mishra, Sagarika (Deakin University)",2,2,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pacfin.2023.102031,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1157273820,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

While these studies explored the impact of per capita income on road deaths and road injuries, no studies have examined the relationship between per capita income and road death to road injury ratio (DPI).
METHOD: Using a fixed effects panel regression analysis from 67 countries spanning over a period of five decades (1960-2013), the present study sought to explore the impact of per capita gross domestic product (per capita GDP) on the DPI ratio and the underlying factors responsible for the relationship.
RESULTS: Our result suggests that per capita GDP followed a reverse U-shaped relationship with DPI. Moreover, the relative improvements in higher mobility roads as compared to improvements in higher accessibility roads, motorcycle ownership to passenger car ownership ratio, percentage of population living in an urban area, infant mortality rate, and the percentage of population below 15É??years of age and above 64É??years of age contributed to this relationship. Practical Applications: This implies that, at lower level of economic growth where road deaths exceed road injuries, countries should implement low-cost measures to combat road deaths cases. Such measures include mandating wearing of quality helmets and daytime running headlights for motorcycles. On the other hand, at higher level of economic growth where road injuries surpass road deaths, countries are encouraged to devote more resources to improving medical technology and services to treat road injury victims, mandating seatbelt use, as well as enhancing and promoting public transportation service.",This study was sponsored by Universiti Putra Malaysia Research University Grant (Grant No. GP/2017/9564000).,,Journal of Safety Research,,,"Accidents, Traffic; Economic Development; Humans; Infant; Motorcycles; Regression Analysis; Transportation",44377,2021,44377,2021-09,78,,262-269,Closed,Article,"Sirajudeen, Abdurrasheed Olayinka; Law, Teik Hua; Wong, Shaw Voon; Jakarni, Fauzan Mohd; Ng, Choy Peng","Sirajudeen, Abdurrasheed Olayinka (Road Safety Research Centre, Faculty of Engineering, Universiti Putra Malaysia, 43400 Selangor, Malaysia.

People no longer go to the ground floor to receive a postal package. In the meantime, the delivery of postal packages through the balconies and windows of the units on the upper floors of the buildings will gradually become inevitable. Hence, a new Vehicle Routing Problem with Drone mathematical model has been developed with the objective of minimizing total delivery time and with the ability to deliver postal packages in the path of drones at different heights. In addition, the droneÉ??s energy consumption is computed by taking into account wind speed, the weight of the postal parcel, the weight of the drone's body, and other factors in the droneÉ??s path. A two-phase algorithm based on the nearest neighborhood and local search is presented to solve the developed mathematical model in different instances. Several small-sized test problems are designed and solved, and the performance of the heuristic approach is evaluated compared to the outputs of the CPLEX solver. Finally, the proposed model is implemented on a real-world scale to demonstrate the efficacy and applicability of the proposed model as well as the heuristic approach.

However, public sector adoption of ERM has typically focused on the economic efficiency of tax-financed activities based on control-based practices. This reflects an emphasis on quantifiable concerns that invariably directs attention to risk, that (by definition) relates to identifiable and measurable events, thereby downplaying uncertain and unknown aspects of public exposures. This is a potentially serious shortcoming as government entities often act as society's risk managers of last resort. When extreme events happen what were previously considered private matters can quickly turn into public obligations. Hence, there is a need for proactive assessments of the evolving public risk landscape to discern unpredictable-even unknowable-developments.
Methods: The article reviews recent empirical studies on public risk management practices, effects of digitalization in public sector institutions, current strategic management research, and insights uncovered from a recent study of risk management practices in federal agencies. On this basis, the article explains how the ability to generate value from ERM can be enhanced when it intertwines with local responsive initiatives and central strategic risk analyses. It can form a dynamic adaptive risk management process where insights from dispersed actors inform updated risk analyses based on local autonomy and open exchange of information. This approach builds on specific structural features embedded in culture-driven aspirations to generate collaborative solutions. Its functional mode is an interactive control system with open discussions across levels and functions in contrast to conventional diagnostic controls that monitor predetermined key performance indicators (KPIs) and key risk indicators (KRIs).
Findings: Backed by theoretical rationales and empirical research evidence, it is found that applications of ERM frameworks can produce positive results but is unable to deal with a public risk landscape characterized by uncertain unpredictable conditions with potentially extreme outcome effects. It is shown how interactive exchange of fast local insights and slow integrated strategic risk analyses supported by digitized data processing can form a dynamic adaptive system that enable public sector institutions to deal with emergent high-scale exposures. It is explained how the requirement for conducive organizational structures and supportive values require a new strategic risk leadership approach, which is contrasted to observed practices in federal agencies that are constrained by prevailing public governance requirements.
Discussion: The need to deal with uncertainty and unknown conditions demands a cognitive shift in current thinking from a primary focus on risk to also appraise complexity and prepare for the unexpected where data-driven methods can uncover emergent exposures through dynamic information processing. This requires strategic risk leaders that recognize the significance of complex public exposures with many unknowns and a willingness to facilitate digitalized information processing rooted in a collaborative organizational climate. If handled properly, adoption of ERM in public risk management can consider emergent dimensions in complex public exposures applying interactive information processing as a dynamic adaptive risk management approach incorporating digitized methods to solicit collective intelligence for strategic risk updating.",TA acknowledges support from the Independent Research Fund Denmark Grant 8019-00046B for this work as part of a larger project on Risky Business: Managing in a world with extreme exposures.

A firm-level study on the psychological and industrial impacts of COVID-19 on the Chinese stock market,"This study presents a thorough investigation of the relationship between the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and daily stock price changes. We use several types of COVID-19 patients as indicators for exploring whether stock prices are significantly affected by COVID-19É??s impact. In addition, using the Chinese stock market as an example, we are particularly interested in the psychological and industrial impacts of COVID-19 on the financial market. This study makes two contributions to the literature. First, from a theoretical perspective, it shows a novel quantitative relationship between the psychological response to the pandemic and stock prices. In addition, it depicts the mechanism of the shock to the stock market by pointing out the specific functional expression of the impulse reaction. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical calculation of the impulse of a shock to the financial market. Second, this study empirically estimates the marginal effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on fluctuations in stock market returns. By controlling for stock fundamentals, this study also estimates diverse industrial responses to pandemic stock volatility. We confirm that the COVID-19 pandemic has caused panic in the stock market, which not only depresses stock prices but also inflates volatility in daily returns. Regarding the impulse of the shock, we identify the cumulative level of the pandemic variables as well as their incremental differences. As shown by our empirical results, the terms for these differences will eventually dominate the marginal effect, which confirms the fading impulse of the shock. Finally, this study highlights some important policy implications of stock market volatility and returns to work in the industry.",We appreciate the comments and suggestions by the editor(s) and anonymous reviewers.

Evidence from dual vocational education and training curricula in Switzerland,"In an environment of accelerating technological change and increasing digitalization, firms need to adopt new technologies faster than ever before to stay competitive. This paper examines whether updates of education curricula help to bring new technologies faster into firmsÉ?? workplaces. We study technology changes and curriculum updates from an early wave of digitalization (i.e., computer-numerically controlled machinery, computer-aided design, and desktop publishing software). We take a text-as-data approach and tap into two novel data sources to measure change in educational content and the use of technology at the workplace: first, vocational education curricula and, second, firmsÉ?? job advertisements. To examine the causal effects of adding new technology skills to curricula on the diffusion of these technologies in firmsÉ?? workplaces (measured by job advertisements), we use an event study design.

First, the rising share of services, particularly innovation-driven digital and knowledge-based services, in foreign trade and multinational enterprise activity; and second, the increasingly important role of global cities as home and hosts to these activities. Our framework distinguishes between national economic policies to promote trade and FDI, referred to as economic diplomacy, and comparable policies originating in cities, referred to as city diplomacy. National economic diplomacy has traditionally promoted trade and investment in goods, often through trade agreements and promotion agencies, and we explore the limitations of these tools as trade in services becomes more important. However, we also note that trade in services, particularly innovation-driven services, is concentrated in global cities, and traded between them, often within MNEs. We conclude that national policies on trade and investment cannot be divorced from innovation and knowledge strategies, and that these strategies cannot be divorced from cities. We emphasize that national economic diplomacy should be better aligned with city diplomacy. We also discuss how the transition to stronger city diplomacy may have consequences for firms and their strategies for corporate diplomacy.","Ideas in this paper were developed as part of a Knowledge Synthesis Grant, ES/S008373/1, funded jointly by Canada (SSHRC) and the UK (ESRC) entitled: É??The (New) Geography of International Trade and Investment: Exploring the extent to which É??distanceÉ?? matters in the establishment of economic relationsÉ?ù.

Since this strategic development, the number of trucks, private car, and passenger car registrations have continued to grow, with a corresponding increase in related to benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX).
Objectives: This study aims to compare the levels of trans, trans-muconic acid (t, t MA); toluene (TU); mandelic acid (MA); and methyl hippuric acid (MHA) in the urine of gas station employees, considering demographic and occupational factors.
Material and methods: These employees worked either near or away from the fuel dispenser, and there 100 people in each group. Data were collected using interviews and testing environmental air and urine samples for benzene, toluene, ethyl benzene, and xylene (BTEX).
Results: The results showed that BTEX concentrations were just detectable in all 200 cases (100%). The mean (?ÒSD) urine level of t, t MA was 449.28 (?Ò213.32) ?¨g/g creatinine, while the median (min-max) was 428.23 (95.58-1202.56) ?¨g/g creatinine. The mean TU was 0.011 (0.001) mg/L, while the median (min-max) was 0.011 (0.010-0.013) mg/L. MA levels were higher inside the pollution control zone than they were outside the zone (p=.009). Employees who practiced poor personal hygiene had relatively high urinary toluene and MHA levels (p=.009) and those who did not wear personal protective equipment (PPE) had relatively high MA levels (p=.040).

This study compares experiences and perceptions of FWP and related policy interventions before and during the COVID-19 shutdown, using a mixed-methods approach focusing on the South Bay region of Los Angeles County, to inform projections about the use of FWP and policy implications post-COVID. Pre-shutdown surveys and focus groups interviews confirmed that major obstacles to FWP expansion were a combination of managerial and executive resistance, alongside occupational constraints. Pre-shutdown interviews suggested that costs associated with manager training and cultural transition are major concerns for executives. A small sample of follow-up interviews with executives, managers, and staff, conducted during the shutdown period has revealed some of the practical issues with full-time FWP such as work-life balance, childcare, productivity, IT hardware and software, and network connectivity. Although organizations have been forced into flexible arrangements, many are considering continuing to utilize the practices after the pandemic settles down. In terms of policy interventions, pre-COVID participants perceived government subsidies and incentives as the most desirable government programs. However, in a resource-constrained post-COVID world, policy makers might instead focus on training programs and promotional campaigns tied to public health messaging, and the implications of reduced commuting for transportation system design and commercial zoning and land use.","California State University Transportation Center at San Jose State University and the South Bay Workforce Investment Board (SBWIB) provided funding for this study.

As the operability of network nodes relies on the operability of connected nodes, network disruptions have the potential to spread across entire networks, having catastrophic consequences in the realms of physical network performance and also economic performance. While risk-informed physical network models and economic models have been well-studied in the literature, there is limited study of how physical features of network performance interact with sector-specific economic performance, particularly as these physical networks recover from disruptions of varying durations. In this article, we create a generalizable framework for integrating Functional Dependency Network Analysis (FDNA) and Dynamic Inoperability Input-Output Models (DIIM), to assess the extent to which disruptions to critical infrastructure could degrade its functionality over a period of time. We demonstrate the framework using disruptive scenarios for a critical transportation network in Virginia, USA. We consider scenarios involving: (a) mild case that is relatively more frequent such as recurring traffic conditions; (b) moderate case involving an incident with a multihour delay, and (c) severe case that is relatively less frequent such as evacuation after a major hurricane. The results will be useful for network managers, policymakers, and stakeholders who are seeking to invest in risk mitigation for network functionality and economic activity.",ACKNOWLEDGMENT Funding was provided by the following National Science Foundation Grants: Grant No. 1832635: CRISP 2.0 Type 2: Collaborative Research: Organizing Decentralized Resilience in Critical InterdependentÉ?êinfrastructure Systems and Processes (ORDERÉ?êCRISP) and Grant No. 1948261: CRII: SaTC: GraphÉ?êbased Probabilistic Cyber Risk Modeling.,,Risk Analysis,,,"Cyclonic Storms; Models, Economic; Transportation; Virginia",44467,2021,44467,2022-05,42,5,1106-1123,Closed,Article,"Tatar, Unal; Santos, Joost R.; Thekdi, Shital A.","Tatar, Unal (College of Emergency Preparedness, Homeland Security and Cybersecurity, University at AlbanyÉ??State University of New York, Albany, NY, USA); Santos, Joost R.

The research question of this study is, ""is feeling well-being, as a consequence of dark tourism, a way of banalizing the horror?"". The purpose of this study is threefold: to provide an updated systematic literature review (SLR) of dark tourism associated with Holocaust sites and visitors' well-being; to structure the findings into categories that provide a comprehensive overview of the topics; and to identify which topics are not well covered, thus suggesting knowledge gaps. Records to be included should be retrievable articles in peer-reviewed academic journals, books, and book chapters, all focused on the SLR's aims and the research question; other types of publications were outrightly excluded. The search was performed in Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar databases with three keywords and combinations: ""dark tourism"", ""Holocaust"", and ""well-being"". Methodological decisions were based on the Risk of Bias Assessment Tool for Nonrandomized Studies (RoBANS). This systematic review adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. During the process, 144 documents were included, of which 126 were journal articles, 8 were books, and 10 were book chapters. The results point out a hierarchical structure with the main category (Dark tourism - Holocaust - Well-being) and three second-order categories (Dark tourism - Holocaust, Dark tourism - Well-being, and Holocaust - Well-being), from which different subcategories emerge: motivations for visiting places and guiding; ambivalent emotional experience that leads to the transformation of the self; and intergenerational trauma. The gaps identified were the trivialization of horror in Holocaust places; dark tourist profile; motivations and constraints behind visiting dark places; Holocaust survivors and their descendants' well-being; how dark tourism associated with the Holocaust positively or negatively impacts well-being. Major limitations included: lack of randomized allocation; lack of standard outcome definitions; and suboptimal comparison groups. Positive and negative impacts on the well-being of the Holocaust dark tourist were sought, as they are associated with the marketing and management, promotion, digital communication, guiding, or storytelling design of such locations.",,This research received no external funding.,Heliyon,,,,44944,2023,44944,2023-01,9,1,e13064,All OA; Gold,Article,"Magano, Jos??; Fraiz-Brea, Jos??

However, micro-jurisdictions often face significant challenges with respect to resource availability, administration and local governance. This paper examines the forensic service provision in Seychelles as an example of a micro-jurisdiction forensic delivery system. The impact of limited resources and remote access to consumables or services have prompted the prospective shift to localise commonly utilised forensic services. The potential for a solid foundation for a sustainable forensic service is examined in relation to jurisdictions with more advanced forensic service delivery. Reforms of the legal framework, administration, and governance structures are some of the key underpinnings for an effective forensic delivery system built on a culture of transparent science that promotes justice and creates public confidence.","JTB is supported by a postgraduate scholarship from the Government of Seychelles. We would like to thank Ted Barbe (Seychelles Police), Anna Heavey (PathWest Forensic Biology and Curtin University) and Talia Newland (Curtin University) for their feedback on drafts of this paper. The views and opinions expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the official policy or position of the Seychelles Police.","Increasing the capacity of forensic science services requires important investment in personnel, infrastructure, and consumables. This is illustrated by the projection of an 86% increase in the current goods and services cost for the first year of operation of the facility, decreasing to an expected 56% the following year [8,45]. In the context of small jurisdictions, it is paramount that the scarcity of resources is managed effectively to provide maximum societal impact [46,47] on the investment. Introducing solutions that can improve efficiency and gauging their effectiveness is an essential aspect to ensure an economically sustainable forensic service. For example, a laboratory information management system (LIMS) can automate part of the workflow and positively impact quality and cost [11,48]. Many of the solutions being adopted today are hallmarks from decades-old challenges faced by forensic science laboratories around the world. Forensic services under current development can take benefits from these examples, with customisation where necessary to meet individual jurisdictional needs. Despite the possibilities, it is important to recognise that the potential benefits of science or new technology are not automatic, as it has been shown [48] that there is historical disparity between the potential of forensic science and its actual use. Hence, the rationale of economic choices must be based on quality information and validation [13]. The ability to benchmark the forensic service is thus essential to ensure effective and efficient use of science and technology to fulfill its purpose [12]. In this context, we refer to benchmarking as the sharing and comparison of standardised information to measure products, services, and processes between institutions across a particular industry [49]. This allows for identification and adoption of best practices across the industry while determining key performance indicators (KPIs) to objectively measure quality and performance progress [12,50]. Project FORESIGHT is now the standard for benchmarking of forensic service provision. With the engagement of 178 laboratories globally, Project FORESIGHT provides a platform for the forensic service management community to share operational data using standardised terminology that can be analysed to improve laboratory performance. At this crossroads in SeychelleÉ??s forensic science development, engagement with Project FORESIGHT is a golden opportunity to capture and utilise the knowledge gained from other jurisdictions. With over 10 years of industry data, it is an invaluable resource for small jurisdictions looking to manage scarcity of resources for sustainable forensic service development. The identification and use of appropriate KPIs would be in line with the full adoption of Performance Based Budgeting (PBB) and Performance Monitoring and Evaluation (PME) by the Government of Seychelles in 2016 [51]. Additionally, the measurement of the return on investment can align the optimal use of resources to synergise with societal objectives [50]. Overall, these metrics would assist micro-jurisdiction forensic services with evidence-based arguments for competing public funds with other institutions [12] and as a feedback loop for continuous improvement opportunities [52].",Forensic Science International Synergy,,,,44243,2021,44243,2021,3,,100139,All OA; Gold,Article,"Bouzin, Jemmy T.; Sauzier, Georgina; Lewis, Simon W.","Bouzin, Jemmy T.

The gaps reveal that there is tough competition among the firms in the automobile industry in India. The study also uses the problem structuring method to structure the key problem of Tata Motors' inadequate leverage of product platforms and identify the high potential root causes. The findings reveal that strategic options such as proper management of employees at top leadership positions, technologies, and strategic cooperation with partner firms may help Tata Motors better leverage new modular platforms. The new strategic options may also provide possibilities to scale internationally in niche vehicle product segments to achieve sustained competitive advantage.

The standard statistical approaches to assessment of insurability and potential mispricing are enhanced in several aspects involving consideration of model risk. Model risk can arise from model uncertainty and parameter uncertainty. We demonstrate how to quantify the effect of model risk in this analysis by incorporating various robust estimators for key model parameters that apply in both marginal and joint cyber risk loss process modelling. Through this analysis we are able to address the question that, to the best of our knowledge, no other study has investigated in the context of cyber risk: is model risk present in cyber risk data, and how does is it translate into premium mispricing?

Unfortunately, the problems of misinformation and disinformation are exacerbated due to the wide availability of online platforms and social networks. Naturally, these emerging disinformation networks could lead users to engage with critical infrastructure systems in harmful ways, leading to broader adverse impacts. One such example involves the spread of false pricing information, which causes drastic and sudden changes in user commodity consumption behavior, leading to shortages. Given this, it is critical to address the following related questions: (i) How can we monitor the evolution of disinformation dissemination and its projected impacts on commodity consumption? (ii) What effects do the mitigation efforts of human intermediaries have on the performance of the infrastructure network subject to disinformation campaigns? (iii) How can we manage infrastructure network operations and counter disinformation in concert to avoid shortages and satisfy user demands? To answer these questions, we develop a hybrid approach that integrates an epidemiological model of disinformation spread (based on a susceptible-infectious-recovered model, or SIR) with an efficient mixed-integer programming optimization model for infrastructure network performance. The goal of the optimization model is to determine the best protection and response actions against disinformation to minimize the general shortage of commodities at different nodes over time. The proposed model is illustrated with a case study involving a subset of the western US interconnection grid located in Los Angeles County in California.","This research was partially funded by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Center of Excellence for Risk-Based Community Resilience Planning through a cooperative agreement with Colorado State University [70NANB20H008 and 70NANB15H044].

SbD is a dynamic and anticipatory strategy for safety regulation in academic research. In this strategy, safety is taken in a broader sense including not only issues of technical precaution of avoiding risks of experimentation but also the societal responsibility of researchers and research institutes of identifying possible future risks. In our research, we have interviewed academic researchers from different disciplines and university support personnel about the factors that enable and limit the possibilities of researchers to implement SbD in safety regimes for experimentation. We articulate our findings in terms of a core set of research values and in terms of conflicts between safety and these research values. And we argue that tools for resolving value conflicts as originating in design for values research can provide directions to solve the value conflicts, and thus help academic researchers to adopt SbD in their experimentation.","The interviews and identification of the value conflicts were carried out in the project É??Safety-by-Design als onderdeel van verantwoord onderzoek &amp; innovatie bij Nederlandse onderzoeksinstitutenÉ?ù, conducted in 2019.

However, the relationship between work and sustainability is still little known in company practices. Based on the concepts of activity-centered ergonomics (ACE) and psychodynamics of work (PDW), this paper investigates the meaning of ""sustainable work"" in Brazilian companies. Thus, two research questions guided this study: How the concept of ""sustainable work"" can be defined in the perception of companies based on the perspective of ACE and PDW? How the concepts provided by these approaches can help companies in developing practices towards sustainable work?
METHOD: Case studies conducted in ten Brazilian companies engaged in corporate sustainability practices involving document analysis, interviews, and content analysis.
RESULTS: Companies recognize the importance of human action in organizational processes, by considering people as the cornerstone for ensuring corporate sustainability, and seeking to build a work with meaning and significance. However, i) Improvement actions are usually mitigatory or compensatory, acting on the effects while the root causes remain untouched; ii) Sustainability initiatives focus on individual issues, in most cases on the leader (individual), narrowing its scope and neglecting broader, important topics such as work organization and work content; iii) Both work overload and work for sustainability agenda are usually disregarded; iv) A comprehensive view of health should not be limited to the workplace.
CONCLUSIONS: According to companies' perceptions, sustainable work includes but is not limited to integrating work to corporate sustainability guidelines, respecting labor laws and human rights, developing synergy between areas/departments towards sustainability, providing possibilities for constructing health in its multidimensionality with the worker as protagonist, and creating work that is meaningful, pleasurable and leads to happiness and recognition. ACE and PDW offer valuable concepts to support companies in bridging the gap between their corporate sustainability vision and practices, i.e., transforming guidelines into actions towards sustainable work. In this sense, sustainable work is believed to be that which improves the organization's performance and promotes professional development as well as workers' health broadly and positively (not limited to the absence of illness, but in the sense of building health) and well-being. Thus, it fosters respect for and the development of intelligence and creativity (as opposed to alienating work) by performing work that has meaning and significance, understanding the profound importance of physical, cognitive and organizational issues, and above all, the importance of work to the development of culture (Bolis et al., 2014).",The authors gratefully acknowledge the Brazilian research funding agencies Funda???úo de Amparo ?ˇ Pesquisa do Estado de S?úo Paulo (FAPESP - project 2011/13909-1) and Coordena???úo de Aperfei??oamento de Pessoal de N??vel Superior (CAPES - process n?ß 1808446) for its financial support.,,Applied Ergonomics,,,Brazil; Ergonomics; Humans; Organizational Culture; Psychoanalysis; Social Responsibility; Sustainable Development; Workplace,44024,2020,44024,2020-11,89,,103209,Closed,Article,"Brunoro, Claudio M.; Bolis, Ivan; Sigahi, Tiago F.A.C.; Kawasaki, Bruno C.; Sznelwar, Laerte I.","Brunoro, Claudio M.

However, hospitals have been at risk of running out of the safe and effective PPE including personal protective clothing needed to treat patients with COVID-19, due to unprecedented global demand. In addition, there are only limited manufacturing facilities of such clothing available worldwide, due to a lack of available knowledge about relevant technologies, ineffective supply chains, and stringent regulatory requirements. Therefore, there remains a clear unmet need for coordinating the actions and efforts from scientists, engineers, manufacturers, suppliers, and regulatory bodies to develop and produce safe and effective protective clothing using the technologies that are locally available around the world. In this review, we discuss currently used PPE, their quality, and the associated regulatory standards. We survey the current state-of-the-art antimicrobial functional finishes on fabrics to protect the wearer against viruses and bacteria and provide an overview of protective medical fabric manufacturing techniques, their supply chains, and the environmental impacts of current single-use synthetic fiber-based protective clothing. Finally, we discuss future research directions, which include increasing efficiency, safety, and availability of personal protective clothing worldwide without conferring environmental problems.",The authors respectfully acknowledge all frontline workers (É??HeroesÉ?ù) around the world for the wonderful care and work they are providing on a daily basis during the current COVID-19 pandemic.

Hospitality employees are currently affected by job insecurity. The purpose of this research was to investigate the effect of job insecurity on intention to quit among hospitality workers, integrating the mediating effect of psychological distress and resistance to change and their mutual relationship. A total of 312 surveys were completed in four four- and five-star hotels in the UAE (Dubai and Sharjah). The SmartPLS 4 software was used to test the hypotheses in a mediation model with the bootstrapping method. The results showed that all of the direct links were positive and significant, and mediating relationships were confirmed. This study found that job insecurity predicts intention to quit through psychological distress and resistance to change acting as mediators, and these factors themselves also impact significantly on intention to quit. Resistance to change is impacted significantly by job insecurity and psychological distress, which suggests that a deeper approach to employees' resistance to change should be taken, especially when conducting performance appraisals in the hotel industry, by searching for its roots and aiming to minimize employees' intention to quit.",,This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Beatriz Sora, Amparo Caballer",Humans; Intention; Employment; Psychological Distress; Surveys and Questionnaires,44854,2022,44854,,19,20,13629,All OA; Gold,Article,"Baquero, Asier","Baquero, Asier (Department of Business Studies, Westford University College, UCAM, Al Taawun St., Sharjah P.O.

First, an effort is made to show a consequential effect of maritime insecurity on seafarers and marine professionals; they are at risk of a complicated string of processes that impact their lives. Second, there is the risk to the environment and property. Third, the economic cost of traditional maritime crimes is examined against the potential maritime trade expansion from implementing the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). Third, the policy and regulatory measures implemented in the region against piracy are assessed to propose additional measures for improvement. Essentially, the study deploys a case study approach with a three-year field observation over the Gulf of Guinea region and is supported by outcomes of various remote interviews, in addition to online surveys conducted over three monthsÉ??findings are juxtaposed with the estimated cost of piracy and potential implications for policies driving economic advancement. The results showed inadequate maritime surveillance despite enormous legal frameworks amidst the current structures of regional and international corporations. The piracy cost is high and inevitable as a factor of insurance coverage passed onto end consumers. Response to piracy has been reactionary rather than proactive, as attacks have continued in territorial and offshore areas into 2021. The impact will be visible on AfCFTA post-COVID-19. The study highlights the need for a community-based approach to surveillance modelled after the community policing model currently implemented in Ghana.","The authors wish to thank every individual who went out of their comfort to help with this study, especially those who were willing to share their experiences with us that provided a revealing interest.

The lack of tourists has huge consequences not only for the tourism industry, but also for the tourism economy. Health tourism enterprises are also affected by this problem, but their situation is somewhat different from other tourism enterprises, as the relationship of these enterprises with the healthcare system provides an opportunity to continue operations, albeit in a different role than the tourism function. The diagnostic objective of this article is to assess the impact of the pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus on the activities of tourism and medical tourism enterprises operating in spa destinations after 12 months of the pandemic situation. The cognitive objective, on the other hand, is to identify the roles that these companies play in reducing the impact of epidemic risks. The article presents the results of the research conducted in 19 tourism and medical companies, covering 115 sanatorium facilities, run in Polish health spas. The results indicate that although their economic situation is difficult, it is at the same time stable. Two reasons in particular stand out: (1) financial support from government anti-crisis programs; and (2) implementation of rapid organizational changes that enable the implementation of epidemiological prevention tasks, relieving the burden on infectious diseases hospitals by operating an isolation center, a vaccination center, or a quarantine facility for asymptomatic patients.

These models can effectively contribute to solving the split-incentive issue that arises in the rented building scenario. Some of them are obtained from their ""traditional"" counterparts, which do not consider the rented scenario, but just a bipartite agreement between an Energy Service Company and its client. The EU Horizon 2020 project SmartSPIN (Smart energy services to solve the SPlit INcentive problem in the commercial rented sector) targets delivery of enhanced energy services for commercial rented sector. These enhanced energy services (a) combine demand management services and energy efficiency interventions, (b) facilitate the adoption of renewables, (c) optimize the balance between demand and supply, (d) alleviate the split incentive issue. The pilot implementation of SmartSPIN is in progress in a business park in Greece, in an office building in Ireland and in two shopping centers in Spain. Key recommendations toward the implementation of such a smart energy service are provided in this paper. They have been obtained from a detailed analysis of ten interviews of key stakeholders of the energy efficiency sector and of the commercial rented sector, along with an analysis of a selection of the most relevant technical literature. This paper argues that the classical shared savings and guaranteed savings ESCOs models may be adapted to the commercial rented sector and used at SmartSPIN's demonstration sites in Spain, Greece and Ireland. The guaranteed savings model appears to be the most appropriate one to use when the building owner is funding the energy efficiency project using own funds or liaising directly with a bank or other finance provider. The validation method for the comparative analysis of business models and selection of the most appropriate one is based on both literature review and consultation of selected stakeholders' (stakeholder value creation framework).",,"This project has received funding from the European UnionÉ??s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the grant agreement No 101033744 (Smart energy services to solve the SPlit INcentive problem in the commercial rented sector SmartSPIN).

TSP serves only human-type customers, thus constructing new business processes for the IoT, a non-human customer base, is a challenge to be addressed. Some large companies that are transforming business processes face difficulties in using the strategic framework for reasons such as ineffective management of organizational change, internal resistance, technical issues, and conflicts between frameworks and business needs. The enterprise architecture (EA) is a comprehensive strategic framework that involves company analysis, design, and solution implementation. This study examines transformation project implementation based on the EA model as a prototype, from business strategy to practice, using the concept of three intersections among project management, strategic management, and business processes. Thus, the aims of this study are to develop a method for implementing a telecommunications cross-industry collaboration project with an IoT-based company, and heuristic implementation of the method as a research initiative in producing an EA model as a project prototype.

With at the time of writing, the COVID-19 pandemic entering in many countries a third wave with a very differentiated implementation path of vaccination across rich and poor countries, drawing such a parallel remains of course a relatively speculative exercise. Nevertheless, based on the available evidence of the first wave of the pandemic, we feel confident that some lessons from the current health crisis and its parallels with the long-term environmental crisis can be drawn. The COVID-19 pandemic has also been described as a "" syndemic "": a term popular in medical anthropology which marries the concept of 'synergy' with 'epidemic' and provides conceptually an interesting background for these posthumous Freeman reflections on crises. The COVID-19 crisis affects citizens in very different and disproportionate ways. It results not only in rising structural inequalities among social groups and classes, but also among generations. In the paper, we focus on the growing inequality within two particular groups: youngsters and the impact of COVID-19 on learning and the organization of education; and as mirror picture, the elderly many of whom witnessed despite strict confinement in long-term care facilities, high mortality following the COVID-19 outbreak. From a Freeman perspective, these inequality consequences of the current COVID-19 health crisis call for new social STI policies: for a new ""corona version"" of inclusion versus exclusion.",Declaration of Competing Interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,,Research Policy,,,,44482,2021,44482,2022-01,51,1,104393,All OA; Green,Article,"Dosi, Giovanni; Soete, Luc","Dosi, Giovanni (Institute of Economics, EMbeDS, Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna, Pisa, Italy.); Soete, Luc (UNU-MERIT, Maastricht University, Netherlands and Brussels School of Governance, VUB, Belgium.)","Soete, Luc (Maastricht University; Vrije Universiteit Brussel)","Dosi, Giovanni (Sant'Anna School of Advanced Studies); Soete, Luc (Maastricht University; Vrije Universiteit Brussel)",17,17,1.1,10.73,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc8511438?pdf=render,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141837514,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",10 Reduced Inequalities

Thus, marketers need to understand consumer segments based on pandemic-related responses and behaviors. Through two studies conducted 9É??months apart, we find that consumers shift from three segments in Study 1-the Apprehensive, the Prepared, and the Dismissive, to two segments in Study 2-the Dedicated and the Dismissive. The Apprehensive feel particularly threatened of the virus. The Prepared and the Dedicated perceive a lower susceptibility but still take the health threat seriously. The Dismissive downplay the threat and exhibit more negative reactions to mitigation measures. We also demonstrate between-segment downstream response differences. While the Apprehensive and the Prepared/Dedicated exhibit positive attitude toward companies enforcing guidelines, the Apprehensive engage in the most panic buying, hoarding, and stockpiling. The Dedicated also express greater stress and less life satisfaction than the Dismissive.

These activities resulted in potentially lethal opioid residue contamination which remained after police intervention. This case details the environmental assessment and sampling procedures, findings, and decontamination processes that were used to mitigate the property. A safe re-occupancy criterion was established and used as the basis for adoption of a state standard for residential cleanup in California. Regulatory hurdles and key lessons are presented so that others may consider development of similar public health policy. Involvement of public health departments in the assessment and cleanup of sites contaminated with opioids and other illicit drugs and the development of standards for cleanup and worker protection is an important and yet often overlooked public health measure.","The author thanks and acknowledges the following individuals for their direct and indirect contributions to content, technical support, and references associated with the topics and subject matter presented within this article: Dr. Charles B.

The test addresses both the uniform and the asymmetrical transmission of shocks, in relation to sizes of firms and sectors of their activity. To allow for the running of micro stress-tests of this kind, a general model was constructed using a two-step approach comprising a microeconomic model and a macroeconomic module. Accompanying empirical analysis was based on individual data from different sources (relating to the years 2007É??2020), i.e. prudential reporting, business registration, financial and behavioral data and balances of payments. In line with the factor of company size, the quality of loan portfolios is shown to deteriorate on the balance sheets of banks in all segments in the case of a negative scenario (for large and medium-sized enterprises the probability of default increases 1.5-fold, for small ones over threefold). While almost all industries will experience the impact of COVID-19, sections being hit particularly hard will involve services that, due to the ban on gatherings of people and the recommendation to avoid crowds, will lose most of their revenue and will fail to make up for this loss in the future.",,,Eurasian Economic Review,,,,44258,2021,44258,2021-06,11,2,283-319,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Nehrebecka, Natalia","Nehrebecka, Natalia (Faculty of Economic Sciences, Warsaw University, Dè?uga 44/50, 00-241, Warsaw, Poland; National Bank of Poland, è?wié?tokrzyska 11/21, 00-919, Warsaw, Poland)","Nehrebecka, Natalia (University of Warsaw; National Bank of Poland)","Nehrebecka, Natalia (University of Warsaw; National Bank of Poland)",16,14,,10.39,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40822-020-00163-0.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135905986,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3502 Banking, Finance and Investment; 38 Economics; 3801 Applied Economics",

Our work is based on a rich dataset that contains information about companies from Slovenia right after the financial crisis of 2008. The processed data spans for 8 years and covers the transaction history as well as performance indicators and various metadata of the companies. We define sales shocks at different levels, and identify companies impacted by them. Next we investigate stress, the potential immediate upstream and downstream impact of a shock within the production network. We base our main findings on a matched pairs analysis of stressed companies. We find that both shock and stress are associated with reporting bankruptcy in the future and that stress foremost impacts the future sales of customers. Furthermore, we find evidence that stress not only results in performance losses but the reconfiguration of the production network as well. We show that stressed companies actively seek for new trading partners, and that these new links often share the industry of the shocked company.

The study is based on secondary data over a period from 2015 to 2021. The results are estimated using panel data with fixed-effect models. The results indicate that liquidity enhances and strengthens the ability of a company to spend more on environmental, social, and employee compensation sustainability expenses. In the same context, the results reveal that there is an insignificant moderation effect of liquidity with the financial performance of a company, indicating that the liquidity of companies with higher financial performance does not enhance and strength their ability to spend more on sustainability expenses. Further, the extent of liquidity in larger companies affects positively and significantly the level of employee compensation but not environmental and social spending. Finally, the findings show that greater leverage with less liquidity negatively affects the levels of sustainability spending. This study provides a unique contribution to the existing literature by introducing the moderating effect of liquidity on the relationship between firms' specific and sustainability expenditures. It highlights the direct effect of firms' specific determinants and the moderating effect of liquidity on three categories of sustainability expenses which are environmental expenses, social expenses, and employee compensations.

The classical literature on Confucianism exhorted leaders to practice five core virtues as the basis for becoming a noble person (Junzi) and for sustaining harmonious communities built on trust and good example. We present a theory about how the senior management in modern corporations, by enacting the five Junzi virtues through virtuous environmental, social, and governance (ESG) policies and practices, might inspire virtue-based relationships between superiors and subordinates and between employees. We argue that if middle managers and employees observe and experience that their firmÉ??s ESG policies and practices are virtuous, they would feel encouraged to practice those virtues in their own behavior, and thus embody and promote interpersonal harmony. We provide three types of illustration for our theory. First, we map the five Junzi virtues to the content of a specimen ESG report. Second, we map seven subtypes of servant leadership behavior of middle managers to the five Junzi virtues. Third, we map seven types of employee organizational citizenship behavior to the five Junzi virtues.",,,Asian Journal of Business Ethics,,,,44650,2022,44650,2022-06,11,1,183-226,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Snell, Robin Stanley; Wu, Crystal Xinru; Lei, Hong Weng","Snell, Robin Stanley (Department of Management, The Hang Seng University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong); Wu, Crystal Xinru (Department of Management, The Hang Seng University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong); Lei, Hong Weng (Department of Accountancy, The Hang Seng University of Hong Kong, Shatin, Hong Kong)","Wu, Crystal Xinru (The Hang Seng University of Hong Kong)","Snell, Robin Stanley (The Hang Seng University of Hong Kong); Wu, Crystal Xinru (The Hang Seng University of Hong Kong); Lei, Hong Weng (The Hang Seng University of Hong Kong)",6,6,,7.07,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13520-022-00146-1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146729375,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 50 Philosophy and Religious Studies; 5001 Applied Ethics",

Yet, these trends seem almost insignificant compared to labor impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. While much has been written about the pandemic's short-term impacts, this study analyzes anticipated long-term impacts on the labor force of 2029 by comparing original 2029 labor projections to special COVID-adjusted projections recently published by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. Results show that future demand for nearly every type of labor skill and knowledge will increase, while the nature of work shifts from physical to more cognitive activities. Of the nearly three million jobs projected to disappear by 2029 due to COVID, over 91% are among workers without a bachelor's degree. Among workers with a degree demand shifts primarily from business-related degrees to computer and STEM degrees. Results further show that the socialness of labor, which is important for both innovation and productivity, increases in many more industries than it decreases. Finally, COVID will likely accelerate the adoption of teleworking and slightly decrease the rate of workforce automation. These impacts, combined with a shift to more cognitive worker activities, will likely impact the nature of workforce health and safety with less focus on physical injuries and more on illnesses related to sedentary lifestyles. Overall, results suggest that future workers will need to engage more often in training and skill acquisition, requiring life-long learning and skill maintenance strategies.","STS was supported by Grant 2029146 from the US National Science Foundation www.nsf.gov.

However, we know little about the causal mechanisms of the phenomenon which impacted IB. Based on a case study of a Japanese automotive firm in Russia, we investigate how firms tackle institutional entrepreneurship with firm-specific advantages to overcome the disruptive effects. Consequently, the pandemic increased institutional costs due to greater uncertainty in Russian regulatory institutions. To manage this, the firm developed new firm-specific advantages to deal with the increasing uncertainty of regulative institutions. The firm united with other firms to motivate public officials to advocate for semi-official debates.

The evidence suggests that energy consumption has a positive impact on CO2 emissions for all income panels whilst the moderating effect of TO appears to be a key degrading factor of environmental quality in low- and middle-income countries. In addition, TOÉ??s interaction with GDP growth is found to negatively affect environmental quality across all income groups.

Unit trains only experience risks on mainlines and when arriving at or departing from terminals, while manifest trains experience additional switching risks in yards. A comprehensive risk assessment methodology is needed to quantitively compare shipments with unit trains and manifest trains, considering both mainline and yard operations. To fulfill this research gap, this paper constructs event chains for line-haul risks, arrival/departure risks, and yard switching risks using various probabilistic models and finally determines expected casualties as the consequences of a potential train derailment and release incident. Five illustrative scenarios are designed to analyze the best and worst cases and compare the transportation risk differences between service options using unit trains and manifest trains. The comparison results indicate that placing all tank cars at the positions with the lowest probability of derailing and switching tank cars alone in classification yards could provide the lowest risk estimate given the same transportation demand.","This research was funded through a contract by the Federal Railroad Administration (693JJ619C000017).

        We analyze the supply-side disruptions associated with COVID-19. We find that sectors in which a higher fraction of the workforce is not able to work remotely experienced greater declines in employment and expected revenue growth, worse stock market performance, and higher likelihood of default. The stock market overweights low-exposure industries. Thus, our findings cast light on the disconnect between stock market indices and aggregate outcomes. We combine these ex ante heterogeneous industry exposures with daily financial market data to create a stock return portfolio that tracks news about the supply-side disruptions resulting from the pandemic.

This paper examines the risk-return characteristics of clean energy equities at a disaggregate level using a battery of performance metrics. The main results provide evidence of significant heterogeneity across clean energy sub-sectors; for instance, fuel cell and solar stocks display higher downside risks than the others, while the developer/operator equities are the least risky. The findings further provide evidence of higher risk-adjusted returns during the coronavirus pandemic; as an example, energy management companies appear to provide the highest risk-adjusted returns in the wake of the COVID-19.

Objectives: The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of broad categories of safety interventions in preventing accidents at work. The review aims to compare effects of safety interventions to no intervention, usual activities, or alternative intervention, and if possible, to examine which constituent components of safety intervention programs contribute more strongly to preventing accidents at work in a given setting or context.
Date Sources: Studies were identified through electronic bibliographic searches, government policy databanks, and Internet search engines. The last search was carried out on July 9, 2015. Gray literature were identified by searching OSH ROM and Google. No language or date restrictions were applied. Searches done between February and July of 2015 included PubMed (1966), Embase (1980), CINAHL (1981), OSH ROM (NIOSHTIC 1977, HSELINE 1977, CIS-DOC 1974), PsycINFO (1806), EconLit (1969), Web of Science (1969), and ProQuest (1861); dates represent initial availability of each database. Websites of pertinent institutions (NIOSH, Perosh) were also searched.
Study Eligibility Criteria Participants and Interventions: Included studies had to focus on accidents at work, include an evaluation of a safety intervention, and have used injuries at work, or a relevant proxy, as an outcome measure. Experimental, quasi-experimental, and observational study designs were utilized, including randomized controlled trials (RCTs), controlled before and after (CBA) studies, and observational designs using serial measures (interrupted time series, retrospective cohort designs, and before and after studies using multiple measures). Interventions were classified by approach at the individual or group level, and broad categories based on the prevention approach including modification of: Attitudes (through information and persuasive campaign messaging).Behaviors (through training, incentives, goal setting, feedback/coaching).Physiological condition (by physical training).Climate/norms/culture (by coaching, feedback, modification of safety management/leadership).Structural conditions (including physical environment, engineering, legislation and enforcement, sectorial-level norms). When combined approaches were used, interventions were termed ""multifaceted,"" and when an approach(es) is applied to more than one organizational level (e.g., individual, group, and/or organization), it is termed ""across levels.""
Study Appraisal and Synthesis Methods: Narrative report review captured industry (NACE), work setting, participant characteristics, theoretical basis for approach, intervention fidelity, research design, risk of bias, contextual detail, outcomes measures and results. Additional items were extracted for studies with serial measures including approaches to improve internal validity, assessments of reasonable statistical approaches (Effective Practice of Organization of Care [EPOC] criteria) and overall inference. Random-effects inverse variance weighted meta-analytic methods were used to synthesize odds ratios, rate ratios, or standardized mean differences for the outcomes for RCT and CBA studies with low or moderate levels of heterogeneity. For studies with greater heterogeneity and those using serial measures, we relied on narrative analyses to synthesize findings.
Results: In total 100 original studies were included for synthesis analysis, including 16 RCT study designs, 30 CBA study designs, and 54 studies using serial measures (ITS study designs). These studies represented 120 cases of safety interventions. The number of participants included 31,971,908 individuals in 59 safety interventions, 417,693 groups/firms in 35 safety interventions, and 15,505 injuries in 17 safety interventions. Out of the 59 safety interventions, two were evaluating national prevention measures, which alone accounted for 31,667,110 individuals. The remaining nine safety interventions used other types of measures, such as safety exposure, safety observations, gloves or claim rates. Strong evidence supports greater effects being achieved with safety interventions directed toward the group or organization level rather than individual behavior change. Engineering controls are more effective at reducing injuries than other approaches, particularly when engineered changes can be introduced without requiring ""decision-to-use"" by workplaces. Multifaceted approaches combining intervention elements on the organizational level, or across levels, provided moderate to strong effects, in particular when engineering controls were included. Interventions based on firm epidemiologic evidence of causality and a strong conceptual approach were more effective. Effects that are more modest were observed (in short follow-up) for safety climate interventions, using techniques such as feedback or leadership training to improve safety communication. There was limited evidence for a strong effect at medium-term with more intense counseling approaches. Evidence supports regulation/legislation as contributing to the prevention of accidents at work, but with lower effect sizes. Enforcement appears to work more consistently, but with smaller effects. In general, the results were consistent with previous systematic reviews of specific types of safety interventions, although the effectiveness of economic incentives to prevent accidents at work was not consistent with our results, and effectiveness of physiological safety intervention was only consistent to some extent.
Limitations: Acute musculoskeletal injuries and injuries from more long-time workplace exposures were not always clearly distinguished in research reports. In some studies acute and chronic exposures were mixed, resulting in inevitable misclassification. Of note, the classification of these events also remains problematic in clinical medicine. It was not possible to conduct meta-analyses on all types of interventions (due to variability in approach, context, and participants). The findings presented for most intervention types are from limited sources, and assessment of publication bias was not possible. These issues are not surprising, given the breadth of the field of occupational safety. To incorporate studies using serial measures, which provide the only source of information for some safety interventions such as legislation, we took a systematic, grounded approach to their review. Rather than requiring more stringent, specific criteria for inclusion of ITS studies, we chose to assess how investigators justified their approach to design and analyses, based on the context in which they were working. We sought to identify measures taken to improve external validity of studies, reasonable statistical inference, as well as an overall appropriate inferential process. We found the process useful and enlightening. Given the new approach, we may have failed to extract points others may find relevant. Similarly, to facilitate the broad nature of this review, we used a novel categorization of safety interventions, which is likely to evolve with additional use. The broad scope of this review and the time and resources available did not allow for contacting authors of original papers or seeking translation of non-English manuscripts, resulting in a few cases where we did not have sufficient information that may have been possible to obtain from the authors.
Conclusions and Implications of Key Findings: Our synthesis of the relative effectiveness of workplace safety interventions is in accordance with the Public Health Hierarchy of Hazard Control. Specifically, more effective interventions eliminate risk at the source of the hazard through engineering solutions or the separation of workers from hazards; effects were greater when these control measures worked independently of worker ""decision-to-use"" at the worksite. Interventions based on firm epidemiological evidence of causality and clear theoretical bases for the intervention approach were more effective in preventing injuries. Less effective behavioral approaches were often directed at the prevention of all workplace injuries through a common pathway, such as introducing safety training, without explicitly addressing specific hazards. We caution that this does not mean that training does not play an essential function in worker safety, but rather that it is not effective in the absence of other efforts. Due to the potential to reach large groups of workers through regulation and enforcement, these interventions with relatively modest effects, could have large population-based effects.","Dyreborg J.

In this research note, we integrate insights from cross-cultural research with inquiry in social psychology and public health literatures to advance a theoretically grounded and culturally derived explanation of cross-national variance in the growth rate of COVID-19. Our multi-level analyses, based on longitudinal time series data from 107 nations, and focused on the first 91 days of this pandemic in different nations, illustrate the direct and interactive effects of culture. Specifically, we find that individualism and uncertainty avoidance have a positive impact, while power distance and masculinity have a negative impact, on the growth rate of COVID-19 cases. Three-way interaction analyses between time, government stringency, and culture indicate that early government stringency attenuated pandemic growth, and this attenuation effect was more significant in collectivistic than in individualistic nations, and in high rather than low power distance nations. Our findings provide evidence that can enable policymakers and organizations to develop strategies that not only conform to science but that also consider the cultural orientation of nations.","The authors would like to thank the Editor, Professor Dana Minbaeva and Journal of International Business Studies anonymous reviewers for their extremely constructive and detailed feedback that allowed us to improve our manuscript significantly.",,Journal of International Business Studies,,,,44398,2021,44398,2021-12,52,9,1871-1892,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Dheer, Ratan J.

In these industrial sites denominated ""Seveso sites,"" the urgent need for an effective strategy emerged markedly to handle hazardous activities and to ensure safe conditions. Since then, the main challenging research issues have focused on how to prevent such accident events and how to mitigate their consequences leading to the development of many risk assessment methodologies. In recent years, researchers and practitioners have tried to provide useful overviews of the existing risk assessment methodologies proposing several reviews. However, these reviews are not exhaustive because they are either dated or focus only on one specific topic (e.g., liquefied natural gas, domino effect, etc.). This work aims to overcome the limitations of the current reviews by providing an up-to-date and comprehensive overview of the risk assessment methodologies for handling hazardous substances within the European industry. In particular, we have focused on the current techniques for hazards and accident scenarios identification, as well as probability and consequence analyses for both onshore and offshore installations.

Among them, quarantine, the closure of borders, and social distancing are the ones that have affected transportation systems most severely. With the clear need to avoid all unnecessary direct human contact, an increased interest in contactless transportation and delivery modes emerged. Drones are a promising alternative in this regard, especially for the delivery of essential goods, such as COVID-19 viral tests. In this study, we therefore investigate how drones can be used to distribute viral tests to potentially infected patients. The novel approach that we propose is to use existing drone infrastructure to perform this task, where drones owned and operated by different public and private entities are retrofitted for the distribution of essential goods in the case of emergency. In a wider sense, we hence suggest the establishment of a drone enabled back-up transport system. Potential performance gains are analyzed through a mathematical time and cost model that was developed in close cooperation with the state Red Cross Organization and a utility drone manufacturer. Process design as well as parameter estimation are based on empirical investigation including, but not limited to, accompanying a COVID-19 mobile testing team in the field. The practical feasibility was verified by retrofitting drones initially assigned to other purposes.

For ChinaÉ??s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to succeed as a driver of institutional change in favor of globalization, it must pass the narrative É??viralityÉ?ù test and successfully contend with competing narratives. Rival narratives will be launched by firms and organizations worldwide that expect to win or lose from deglobalization or from new forms of globalization. This study develops a useful framework for establishing the extent to which ChinaÉ??s BRI is a genuine narrative or just a story. In this regard, four testable propositions are put forth to ascertain whether the BRI is values-based, extends an invitation to participate, is open-ended, and is associated with economic performance for both Chinese and non-Chinese participants. The analysis of the BRI-related institutional change that leads to globalization applies a theoretical lens centered on the narrative economics perspective and on the institution-based view and political economy perspective.

Unfortunately, there is not much actionable guidance on why these failures happen or how to prevent them. Our approach contains two novel aspects. First, we argue that system accidents and other failures in systems engineering are manifestations of similar underlying problems. Therefore, we can leverage the literature on accident causation and the many publicly available accident investigation reports to better understand how and why failures in systems engineering occur, and to identify ways of preventing them. Second, to address the lack of concrete guidance on identifying and preventing incipient failures, we provide specific examples of each type of failure cause and of the recommendations for preventing these causes. We analyzed a set of 30 accidents and 33 project failures, spanning a range of industries, and found 23 different failure causes, most of which appear in both accidents and other project failures, suggesting that accidents and project failures do happen in similar was. We also identified 16 different recommended remedial actions. We link these causes and recommendations in a cause-recommendation network, and associate over 900 specific examples of how these causes manifested in failures, and over 600 specific examples of the associated recommended remedial actions, with each cause or recommendation.","KM was awarded Grant Number: 1350589 from the United States National Science Foundation (www.nsf.gov).

The rich variety of relationships and causal patterns discovered characterizes more fully these perspectives, suggesting opportunities for further research within each, and a wider range of conceptual options to target relational paradigms toward different types of organizations, problems, and levels of analysis.

        Over the past century and a half, global technological leadership has shifted from Europe to the United States, while scholars argue that the world has seen that it is now shifting from the United States to China due to ChinaÉ??s extraordinary catch-up in the past four decades, in which the public policy-oriented national innovation system development plays a critical role that might provide an alternative way for innovation-driven development especially for emerging markets. Even though encountering many challenges ahead, China is positioning itself to take over the global innovation leadership in the next few decades. Here in this article, we introduce a serious yet underexplored question: could China go beyond catch-up and become the global innovation powerhouse? Specifically, drawing from the holistic innovation perspective, which is an original theoretical paradigm for the mission-oriented innovation policy change, this article critically reviews, both qualitatively and quantitatively, ChinaÉ??s remarkable innovation progress and main drivers in comparison with G7 countries plus South Korea and India, trying to provide a comprehensive and critical view of state-of-the-art research on ChinaÉ??s innovation catch-up. We further explore the five major challenges that China must take seriously when marching toward the global innovation powerhouse. Finally, we propose a mission-oriented holistic STI policy design framework for both China and other emerging economies to go beyond catch-up in a competitive dynamic world. This article provides a new and holistic perspective to access ChinaÉ??s innovation progress and challenges, also generates novel insights for scholars and public agencies to contribute to global innovation development, with a shared goal of achieving global sustainable development in the post-COVID-19 pandemic world.","Previous version of this article has been presented at the 2018 Sungkyunkwan University Workshop and the 2019 ICC-Tsinghua University Conference in Beijing.

Therefore, guided by resource-based theory and the relational view, this investigation examines how organisations have used coopetition to cope with the novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic. Key examples include retailers sharing information about stock levels, pharmaceutical organisations working together to develop a vaccine, technological giants collaborating for the greater good, and charities forming alliances for a joint cause. This paper strengthens the extant literature by highlighting the heterogeneity of coopetition strategies that firms can use within a global crisis. Practitioners must balance the risks and rewards of coopetition activities. In turn, they should decide whether to continue to cooperate with their competitors once the pandemic has ended, or resume operating under individualistic business models.

The gap between the locus of innovations in pharmaceuticals and the relative stagnation in less developed economies to manage waste originating in this activity seems fruitful for investigations on innovation in integrated micropollutant management strategies. These tensions allow for advances in current knowledge for environmental management and, particularly, finding solutions for the contamination by pharmaceutical micropollutants of urban water bodies in developing countries. We aim to list the main strategies for managing pharmaceutical micropollutants discussed to point out opportunities for developing countries to advance in this direction. Methodologically, we conducted a systematic literature review from 1990 to 2020, covering 3027 documents on ""pharmaceutical micropollutants management."" The framework formed by the macro-approach to integrated management operationalized by the dimensional micro-approaches: technical, organizational, community, and governmental allowed us to understand that (1) the management of pharmaceutical micropollutants tends to occur through a technical approach centered on the removal of aquatic matrices, green chemistry, and urine diversion; (2) management with an organizational approach has enabled removing drugs from water bodies by drug take-back program, collaborative projects, drug use reduction, and better organizational practices; (3) the community approach have helped minimize this type of pollution by reducing the consumption of medicines and the proper destination for medicines that are no longer in use. Finally, the government management approach emerges as a source of legal, economic, and informational instruments to reduce pollution by pharmaceutical micropollutants. Furthermore, these management approaches allowed us to identify 15 opportunities for possible adjustments for developing societies. These opportunities can be promising for practices and research and, in the medium term, contribute to minimizing pollution by pharmaceutical micropollutants in urban waters.",Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper.,"This research was financed in part by the Coordination for the Improvement of Higher Education Personnel - Brazil (CAPES) - Finance Code 001, with resources from the project É??Urban Eco-socioeconomy: socio-productive arrangements and community self-management aiming at sustainable territorial development.É?ù",The Science of The Total Environment,,,"Developing Countries; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Wastewater; Water Pollutants, Chemical",44494,2021,44494,2022-02,809,,151128,Closed,Article,"Barcellos, Demian da Silveira; Procopiuck, Mario; Bollmann, Harry Alberto","Barcellos, Demian da Silveira (Graduate Program in Urban Management (PPGTU), Pontifical Catholic University of Paran?≠ (PUCPR), 1155 Imaculada Concei???úo St, Curitiba, Parana, Brazil.

The strategic behaviors among the participants of senior care service regulation have not been well studied yet. In the process of senior care service regulation, there is a certain game association among three stakeholders, namely, government departments, private pension institutions, and the elderly. This paper firstly constructs an evolutionary game model including the above three subjects and analyzes the evolutionary path of strategic behaviors of each subject and the evolutionary stabilization strategy of the system. On this basis, the feasibility of the evolutionary stabilization strategy of the system is further verified through simulation experiments, and the effects of different initial conditions and key parameters on the evolutionary process and results are discussed. The research results show that (1) There are four ESSs in the pension service supervision system, and revenue is the decisive factor that affects the evolution of the stakeholders' strategy. (2) The final evolution result of the system is not necessarily related to the initial strategy value of each agent, but the size of the initial strategy value will affect the rate of each agent's evolution to a stable state. (3) The increase in the success rate of government regulation, subsidy coefficient and punishment coefficient, or the reduction in the cost of regulation and the fixed subsidy for the elderly can effectively promote the standardized operation of private pension institutions, but the large additional benefits will lead to their tendency to operate in violation of regulations. The research results can provide reference and a basis for government departments to formulate the regulation policy for elderly care institutions.",The authors would like to thank the anonymous reviewers for their constructive comments and suggestions.,This research was funded by the Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province (Grant Number: 2022A1515010966).,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Humans; Government Agencies; Government Regulation; Industry; Government; China,44984,2023,44984,,20,5,4263,All OA; Gold,Article,"Zhang, Zhiyong; Song, Xiaodie; Shi, Yongqiang","Zhang, Zhiyong (Department of Electronic Business, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China.); Song, Xiaodie (Department of Electronic Business, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China.); Shi, Yongqiang (Department of Electronic Business, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou 510006, China.)","Song, Xiaodie (South China University of Technology)","Zhang, Zhiyong (South China University of Technology); Song, Xiaodie (South China University of Technology); Shi, Yongqiang (South China University of Technology)",0,0,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/20/5/4263/pdf?version=1677571573,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1155830364,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

How does the R&D internationalization of emerging market enterprises affect the innovation of those enterprises? Under fierce market competition, do absorption capacity and domestic technology alliances have a significant impact on enterprise innovation? From the perspective of the knowledge-based view, this paper studies 185 enterprises undergoing R&D internationalization in China from 2012 to 2017, using high-dimensional Poisson fixed effects model, we use instrumental (HDFE IV) estimation to explain the impact of R&D internationalization on the innovation of the parent company and the mechanism behind it. The study finds that R&D internationalization positively promotes the parent company's innovation, and domestic technology alliances and absorptive capacity play a partial mediator role in R&D internationalization. In the face of fierce market competition, domestic technical alliances play a significant role in promoting enterprise innovation, while absorptive capacity plays a negative role in promoting enterprise innovation with the moderating effect of market competition.","This study was supported by the project of the National key Social Science Foundation, É??Research on the Main Influencing factors and Operation Promotion Mechanism of Creative Asset-seeking Transnational Mergers and AcquisitionsÉ?ù (Grant No.12AZD034), National key social science foundation of China named É??research on political risks, economic risks, security risks, operational risks and countermeasures for the construction of É??One Belt and One RoadÉ??É?ù.

The research results indicate that when under the following circumstances, corporate members can enhance organizational citizenship behavior for the environment (OCBE) to improve green management performance, gain the favor of green consumers and achieve sustainable consumption goals. First, enterprises should focus on environmental issues and develop their GSV. Second, enterprises should implement the GSV in different aspects, such as product design, processing, marketing and management. Finally, corporate GSV should be in line with the expectations and values of organization members on environmental issues to motivate their OCBE.

However, the financial losses within nature-based tourism due to travel restrictions and park closures will negatively impact tourism income-dependent PAs' management effectiveness. This exploratory study incorporates a risk-assessment framework to investigate and provide first insights into the pandemic's influence on the delivery of management outputs in Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia.Although in 2020, this PA faced a 75% decline in overall revenue compared to the year before, analysis suggests that, in the short term, conservation-related outputs are least affected. Visitor management and PA efforts to support the local community's sustainable development are the most severely impacted first-order outputs. Third-order nature-based tourism-related outputs face average to high risks.This study's risk-assessment framework provides a starting point for a post-pandemic reassessment of the delivery of PA management outputs and decision-making about output prioritisation and resource allocation. Results suggest several new avenues for research.
Management implications: Post-pandemic recovery of PA requires prioritisation risk framework to identify specific objectives that should be addressed first and which require additional effort or funding. Facing a crisis PA will allocate financial resources in a way that sustains primary functions such as conservation until negative trends change, or at least until financial resources become available. PAs require a paradigm shift, which includes tailoring of financial mechanisms to practical and policy purposes, effective allocation of financial resources, and responsible tourism recovery plans that capture the value and efforts of conservation through tourism and investments in nature-based solutions for sustainable tourism within PA.",,,Journal of Outdoor Recreation and Tourism,,,,44350,2021,44350,2023-03,41,,100397,All OA; Green,Article,"Mandié?, Ante","Mandié?, Ante (University of Split, Faculty of Economics, Business and Tourism, Cvite Fiskovié?a 5, 21000, Split, Croatia.)",,"Mandié?, Ante (University of Split)",27,25,,16.31,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9764333,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138574112,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3504 Commercial Services; 3506 Marketing; 3508 Tourism",15 Life on Land

The results shed light on an issue that firms exposed to higher concentrations of air pollution may suffer a higher environmental violation risk, resulting in a higher debt cost. In addition, a further analysis shows that environmental regulatory pressure and heavily polluting firms enhance the influence of air pollution on the cost of debt, while state-owned firms and firms' economic contributions weaken the influence of air pollution on the cost of debt.

To quantitatively test our specific hypotheses regarding the effects of employeesÉ?? perceived risk of COVID-19 and psychological distress on negative performance outcomes, we surveyed 443 healthcare workers who were employed by a group of private hospitals in Zimbabwe. These essential workers were delivering day-to-day frontline services with high exposure to COVID-19 during the pandemic. We find that employeesÉ?? perceived risk of COVID-19 increases their disengagement, turnover intention, burnout, and low morale at a p < 0.05 significance level. These latter relationships are mediated by employeesÉ?? psychological distress at a p < 0.05 significance level. Our findings shed light on how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the cognitions and behaviors of the frontline workers who are vulnerable to this contagious disease. Turnover intentions are amplified among healthcare employees, due to their perceived risk of COVID-19 and the resulting psychological distress. Similarly, burnout becomes predominant as these workers worry about contracting the coronavirus due to the poor working conditions they face.

This study investigates the impact of media attention on corporate environmental governance from 2011 to 2021, using ChinaÉ??s public companies as our samples. The empirical results indicate that media attention consistently and significantly enhances corporate environmental governance. This effect remains robust across endogeneity considerations and alternative tests. Additionally, in regions with higher marketization and stronger rule of law frameworks, the efficacy of media attention in improving corporate environmental performance becomes remarkably pronounced. Further analysis unveils that media attention positively impacts environmental governance by elevating public awareness, refining internal management efficiency, and fostering innovative strategies for minimizing environmental impact. These results offer empirical backing for the reinforcement of external oversight and corporate governance practices.",We sincerely thank the editor and the anonymous referees for their valuable comments on this paper.,This work is financially supported by the National Social Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 22BJY037).,Environmental Science and Pollution Research,,,Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Policy; Mouth; Politics; China,45180,2023,45180,2023-10,30,47,103996-104014,All OA; Green,Article,"Shi, Peihao; Yin, Lihui; Wu, Chuanqing","Shi, Peihao (School of Economic and Management, Wuhan University, 430072, Wuhan, Hubei, China); Yin, Lihui (School of Economic and Management, Wuhan University, 430072, Wuhan, Hubei, China); Wu, Chuanqing (School of Economic and Management, Wuhan University, 430072, Wuhan, Hubei, China)","Wu, Chuanqing (Wuhan University)","Shi, Peihao (Wuhan University); Yin, Lihui (Wuhan University); Wu, Chuanqing (Wuhan University)",1,1,,,https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-2606878/latest.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163999268,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour","16 Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions"

It also accounts for the use of supportive technology as a determinant of coworker trust. The study aims to develop a framework to help organizations understand the complex associations among coworker trust, exchange, and knowledge sharing and recognizes the roles of supportive technology and task interdependence in those associations. A cross-sectional survey of 255 employees at three Kenyan public organizations was analyzed. A hierarchical regression analysis tested five hypotheses in eight models to estimate direct, moderating, and mediating relationships. Coworker trust was positively related to knowledge sharing and TMX. Supportive technology significantly moderated the relationships; however, task interdependence was not statistically significant. The results imply that organizations might increase knowledge sharing by focusing on building trustful bonds among workers.","As an awardee of the Lee Gil Ya scholarship program, F.K. would like to express his deep gratitude to Lee, Gachon University, for providing students in developing countries with opportunities to pursue MasterÉ??s degrees in Business Administration at Gachon University.",This research received no external funding.,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,,Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; Interprofessional Relations; Kenya; Knowledge; Public Sector; Trust,43891,2020,43908,43891,17,6,2009,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kipkosgei, Felix; Son, Seung Yeon; Kang, Seung-Wan","Kipkosgei, Felix (College of Business, Gachon University, Seongnam 13120, Korea;, felixkipkosgei@gmail.com); Son, Seung Yeon (Graduate School of Defense Management, Korea National Defense University, Nonsan 33021, Korea;, faithnet153@naver.com); Kang, Seung-Wan (College of Business, Gachon University, Seongnam 13120, Korea;, felixkipkosgei@gmail.com)","Kang, Seung-Wan (Gachon University)","Kipkosgei, Felix (Gachon University); Son, Seung Yeon (Korea National Defense University); Kang, Seung-Wan (Gachon University)",15,10,1.26,6.77,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/17/6/2009/pdf?version=1584590930,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125786567,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 44 Human Society",

Despite my concern about the near-term outlook, advising business leaders requires that I look past the pandemic. Akcigit and Ates argue that greater concentration among firms and a slowdown in business dynamism is the cause of a myriad of factors that slow economic growth. Furthermore, a slowing pace of growth of the working-age population and an increase in older members of the workforce, as well as a greater number of retirees, has significant economic consequences for the pace of startups. In contrast, it is possible that the shock from COVID may have boosted business formation and pushed technology adoption across generations, perhaps mitigating some of the demographic impediments to technology adoption.

The agenda sets out the aims of our study, which is to investigate the key decisions and actions (or failures to decide or to act) that significantly altered the course of the pandemic, with the aim of improving disaster preparedness and response in the future. It also asks how we can transfer these lessons to other areas of (potential) global catastrophic risk management such as extreme climate change, radical loss of biodiversity and the governance of extreme risks posed by new technologies. Our study aims to identify key moments- 'inflection points'- that significantly shaped the catastrophic trajectory of COVID-19. To that end this Research Agenda has identified four broad clusters where such inflection points are likely to exist: pandemic preparedness, early action, vaccines and non-pharmaceutical interventions. The aim is to drill down into each of these clusters to ascertain whether and how the course of the pandemic might have gone differently, both at the national and the global level, using counterfactual analysis. Four aspects are used to assess candidate inflection points within each cluster: 1. the information available at the time; 2. the decision-making processes used; 3. the capacity and ability to implement different courses of action, and 4. the communication of information and decisions to different publics. The Research Agenda identifies crucial questions in each cluster for all four aspects that should enable the identification of the key lessons from COVID-19 and the pandemic response.","We would like to express our thanks to Jess Whittlestone and Sean ?? h??igeartaigh for helping secure funding for the project, and for early involvement in the research.

Governance scholars emphasize the central role of institutional factors in shaping environmental responsibilities, primarily due to the substantial influence exerted by regulatory institutions. Drawing on institutional theory, we investigate how sub-national institutional factors impact a firm's green investment intensity and explore their moderating influence on the relationship between green investment and a firm's financial performance. Using a database of Chinese listed companies from 2012 to 2019, this study employs fixed effect model as a baseline regression. Our analysis demonstrates that sub-national institutions, such as state-owned enterprises (SOEs), regional development, and cross-listing, have significant and positive impact on corporate green investment. Our study further provide an evidence that green investment significantly improve firms' financial performance. Moreover, the positive effect of green investment on financial performance is stronger in SOEs and in firms of developed regions as compared to their counterparts, and weaker in cross listed firms than those of non-cross listed peers. Our study suggest that subnational institutions play an imperative role in improving environmental quality and financial performance by promoting corporate green investment. To make sure that our findings remain robust to endogeneity, we applied generalized method of moments (GMM) and propensity score matching (PSM) method. Our findings further provide implications for emerging economies with similar shareholding patterns and unbalanced regional development.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare the following financial interests/personal relationships which may be considered as potential competing interests:Imran Saeed reports was provided by The University of Agriculture Peshawar.

A scientific and reasonable share repurchase policy has a significant financial effect in terms of an equity structure optimization, capital structure adjustment, cash holding control, and even management compensation system design. The long-standing share repurchase in the U.K. and U.S. companies and the recent practice of share repurchase by Chinese listed companies imply an important financial proposition: share repurchase is a high-quality financial policy that, when properly applied, will help reduce the cost of capital. The data in this study show that share repurchases can reduce the level of firms' cost of capital and play an important role in enhancing their competitiveness. This study also finds that Chinese listed companies, when formulating and implementing share repurchase programs, do not subjectively view share repurchases as a policy tool to adjust cash holdings and capital structure. In addition, they do not view share repurchases as an alternative to cash dividends but use equity incentives for management as the main intention for share repurchases. This decision-making concept is not conducive to the rational use of share repurchase policies in the long run and should be a cause for concern in the business community. Finally, the leverage and the cash holding path are the main motives affecting share repurchases and are the important fundamental mechanisms in this study, while the mediating mechanism test finds that share repurchases mainly reduce the cost of capital through two information perspectives of analyst following and stock liquidity. The heterogeneity analysis shows that the role of share repurchases in reducing the cost of capital is more obvious in enterprises with fierce product market competition, high institutional investor shareholding.","We would like to thank KGSupport-Academic Submission Services (www.kgsupport.com) for its linguistic assistance during the preparation of this manuscript.

As such, firms use AI to achieve deep market engagement when the firm's data are employed to make informed decisions. This study examines the role of computer-mediated AI agents in detecting crises related to events in a firm. A crisis threatens organizational performance; therefore, a data-driven strategy will result in an efficient and timely reflection, which increases the success of crisis management. The study extends the situational crisis communication theory (SCCT) and Attribution theory frameworks built on big data and machine learning capabilities for early detection of crises in the market. This research proposes a structural model composed of a statistical and sentimental big data analytics approach. The findings of our empirical research suggest that knowledge extracted from day-to-day data communications such as email communications of a firm can lead to the sensing of critical events related to business activities. To test our model, we use a publicly available dataset containing 517,401 items belonging to 150 users, mostly senior managers of Enron during 1999 through the 2001 crisis. The findings suggest that the model is plausible in the early detection of Enron's critical events, which can support decision making in the market.",Acknowledgement Authors are grateful for the contribution of Mr. Shahyad Sharghi in this study.,,Industrial Marketing Management,,,,44110,2020,44110,2020-11,91,,257-273,All OA; Green,Article,"Farrokhi, Aydin; Shirazi, Farid; Hajli, Nick; Tajvidi, Mina","Farrokhi, Aydin (McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada); Shirazi, Farid (Ted Rogers School of Information Technology Management, Ryerson University, Toronto, Canada); Hajli, Nick (School of Management, Swansea University, UK); Tajvidi, Mina (Newcastle University Business School, London, UK)","Shirazi, Farid (Toronto Metropolitan University)","Farrokhi, Aydin (McMaster University); Shirazi, Farid (Toronto Metropolitan University); Hajli, Nick (Swansea University); Tajvidi, Mina (Newcastle University)",54,45,,20.94,https://cronfa.swan.ac.uk/Record/cronfa55363/Download/55363__18738__418f9c5428d3453e97494fa1ccd9bd23.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1131440677,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",

An empirical study of environmental management control systems in Vietnamese companies from the stakeholder management perspective,"The purpose of this study is to address the criticism that corporate environmental activities to meet the UN sustainable development goals (SDGs) are simply greenwashing. To this end, we clarify whether and why corporate environmental activities are effective in achieving SDGs from the stakeholder management perspective. Using data on Vietnamese companies, we first empirically clarify the influence of stakeholder pressure on a company's environmental management control system (EMCS) implementation as a comprehensive approach to environmental activities and maintaining a proactive attitude toward the SDGs. Second, we examine the influence of EMCS implementation on environmental performance with or without proactive attitudes. The main findings are as follows. Companies implementing EMCSs normally improve their environmental performance, and pressure from final consumers and the government is a precondition for this accomplishment. However, if these companies incorporate the SDGs into their business targets, they can actually improve their environmental performance somewhat further, and government pressure plays an important role in this additional accomplishment. Therefore, corporate environmental activities to meet the SDGs work better than existing activities in Vietnam, refuting the criticism of greenwashing. Importantly, the Vietnamese government as a powerful stakeholder has proactively promoted domestic structural change to achieve the SDGs and has enacted many policies to encourage companies to be proactive in their environmental activities.","This paper forms part of the results of research supported by Grant-in-Aids for Scientific Research (B) 19H01549 from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Japan, and the Environment Research and Technology Development Fund (JPMEERF16S11606) from the Environmental Restoration and Conservation Agency, Japan.",,Journal of Environmental Management,,,Asian People; Goals; Government; Humans; Organizations; Sustainable Development,44413,2021,44413,2021-10,296,,113364,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Nishitani, Kimitaka; Nguyen, Thi Bich Hue; Trinh, Trong Quy; Wu, Qi; Kokubu, Katsuhiko","Nishitani, Kimitaka (Research Institute for Economics and Business Administration, Kobe University, 2-1 Rokkodai Nada Kobe, 657-8501, Japan.

                  The COVID-19 pandemic threatens lives and livelihoods, and, with that, has created immediate challenges for institutions that serve affected communities. We focus on implications for local microfinance institutions in Pakistan, a country with a mature microfinance sector, serving a large number of households. The institutions serve populations poorly-served by traditional commercial banks, helping customers invest in microenterprises, save, and maintain liquidity. We report results from É??rapid responseÉ?? phone surveys of about 1,000 microenterprise owners, a survey of about 200 microfinance loan officers, and interviews with regulators and senior representatives of microfinance institutions. We ran these surveys starting about a week after the country went into lockdown to prevent the spread of the novel coronavirus. We find that, on average, week-on-week sales and household income both fell by about 90 per cent. HouseholdsÉ?? primary immediate concern in early April became how to secure food. As a result, 70 per cent of the sample of current microfinance borrowers reported that they could not repay their loans; loan officers anticipated a repayment rate of just 34 per cent in April 2020. We build from the results to argue that COVID-19 represents a crisis for microfinance in low-income communities. It is also a chance to consider the future of microfinance, and we suggest insights for policy reform.",,,Oxford Review of Economic Policy,,,,43955,2020,43955,44102,36,Supplement_1,s138-s168,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Malik, Kashif; Meki, Muhammad; Morduch, Jonathan; Ogden, Timothy; Quinn, Simon; Said, Farah","Malik, Kashif (Department of Economics, Lahore University of Management Sciences); Meki, Muhammad (Department of International Development and Oxford Centre for Islamic Studies, University of Oxford); Morduch, Jonathan (Robert F.

This research describes the development of a model which optimizes a global green ammonia network, considering the costs of production, storage, and transport. In generating the model, we show economies of scale for green ammonia production are small beyond 1 million tonnes per annum (MMTPA), although benefits accrue up to a production rate of 10 MMTPA if a production facility is serviced by a new port or requires a long pipeline. The model demonstrates that optimal sites for ammonia production require not only an excellent renewable resource but also ample land from which energy can be harvested. Land limitations constrain project size in otherwise optimal locations and force production to more expensive sites. Comparison of current crude oil markets to future ammonia markets reveals a trend away from global supply hubs and toward demand centers serviced by regional production.",The work here was supported financially by the Rhodes Trust.

This is especially true when it comes to Mediterranean insular regions as they are climate change (CC) hotspots where adaptation and mitigation policy design is an urgent matter. Looking at 2030 as a time horizon for climate action and focusing on the Balearic Islands, this paper reviews the physical changes projected for the coming decades as a result of CC and analyses their impacts on regional environmental, economic and social variables. Mitigation and adaptation measures are also proposed based on the identified priority impacts. The fact the Balearics are a top world holiday destination allows the analysis to serve as a guide to other Mediterranean islands with tourism-based economies facing similar CC scenarios. Results show the projected rise of temperature and sea level; the reduction of the average precipitation and increase in evapotranspiration, the droughts and the increase in ocean acidification and deoxygenation are the main threats faced by the Balearics, this putting their economy at risk due to the high tourismÉ??s vulnerability to CC. Mitigation and adaptation action on terrestrial and marine ecosystems, water resources, energy, infrastructure and urban planning, human health, economy, law and education is recommended. Sustainable mobility and waste managing are also viewed as important fields for mitigation action. Conclusions show that diversifying the current socioeconomic model is needed to increase the community and territory resilience.","We acknowledge Gabriel Moy?ˇ, Ignacio Catalan, Josep Al??s, Jaume Sureda, Aina Calvo, Olaya ?Ålvarez, Iris E.

Deemed forever chemicals, many congeners bioaccumulate and are incredibly persistent in the environment due to the presence of the strong carbon-fluorine covalent bonds. Notable PFAS compounds include perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and GenX. Robust toxicological knowledge exists for these substances, but regulatory decisions based on this knowledge has fallen behind. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has addressed this issue with the PFAS Action Plan and EPA Council on PFAS, but the regulatory framework is severely lacking. Currently, no federal regulations or standards exist. Many occupational and non-occupational human cohorts exist that can lend knowledge on the environmental implications of PFAS and associated health effects. Occupationally, firefighters face significant exposure risks due to use of PFAS containing aqueous film-forming foams (AFFFs) and personal protective equipment contamination. Non-occupationally, wastewater discharge in North Carolina led to chronic and widespread residential exposure to GenX via drinking water contamination. This public health review seeks to convey the current and future significance of PFAS as an environmental contaminate, to lend considerations on regulatory frameworks within the USA, and to help guide and promote the need for future epidemiological studies in order to tackle this environmental emergency. While the PFAS Action Plan creates a scientific and regulatory foundation, it is important to take these lessons and apply them to future environmental health issues.",,"This work was funded by National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), grant number T03 OH008629-16.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Karthikraj Rajendiran, Tao Zhang, Un-Jung Kim, Maria Pilar Martinez-Moral","Alkanesulfonic Acids; Fluorocarbons; Humans; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency; Wastewater; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Pollution",44492,2021,44492,,18,21,11142,All OA; Gold,Article,"Langenbach, Blake; Wilson, Mark","Langenbach, Blake (Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Tulane University School of Public Health & Tropical Medicine, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.); Wilson, Mark (Department of Environmental Health Sciences, Tulane University School of Public Health & Tropical Medicine, New Orleans, LA 70112, USA.)","Wilson, Mark (Tulane University)","Langenbach, Blake (Tulane University); Wilson, Mark (Tulane University)",32,32,2.66,31.64,https://www.mdpi.com/1660-4601/18/21/11142/pdf?version=1635147080,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142501231,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 48 Law and Legal Studies; 4802 Environmental and Resources Law",

However, there remains to be more research on several critical topics. This includes the characteristics of coordinated development between the digital economy and economic resilience systems and their interdependence. In response, this study formulates a comprehensive evaluative framework for digital economy development and regional economic resilience, grounded in the intrinsic mechanisms of both domains. It conducts a thorough evaluation employing entropy weight-TOPSIS methodology. Additionally, leveraging coupling theory, a coordination model's coupling degree serves as the foundational framework for scrutinizing the symbiotic advancement of the digital economy and economic resilience, along with their interdependent nature. The research sample comprises data from 31 provinces and municipalities in China (excluding Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan) from 2011 to 2020. Spatial autocorrelation and Geodetector methodologies probe the evolutionary traits and driving factors underlying the coordinated developmental relationship between these two systems. The findings indicate an upward trajectory in China's annual comprehensive development index for digital economy development (from 0.233 to 0.458) and regional economic resilience (from 0.393 to 0.497). The coupling and coordination between the two systems, measured from 0.504 in 2011 to 0.658 in 2020, demonstrate a consistent growth pattern with an average annual increase of 3.01%. These levels exhibit continuous improvement, with comprehensive economic zones manifesting hierarchical results within the coupling range of [0.5, 0.8]. Notably, agglomeration development evinces a pronounced spatial positive correlation, while local Moran scattering points are primarily concentrated in localized migration leaps. Factors such as foreign-funded enterprises' total import and export volume, online payment capability, and fiber-optic cable length greatly influence the coupling relationship. In contrast, other variables exhibit a lower and more fluctuating degree of weighted impact. This study establishes a foundation for the synergistic and effective development of the digital economy and economic resilience within the Chinese region. Simultaneously, it offers valuable insights for research of related subjects in global contexts.",,The author(s) received no specific funding for this work.,PLOS ONE,,Fuyou Guo,"Humans; Resilience, Psychological; China; Macau; Hong Kong; Economic Development; Cities",45310,2024,45310,,19,1,e0296890,All OA; Gold,Article,"Gu, Jingshan; Liu, Zongting","Gu, Jingshan (School of Economics and Management, Weifang Institute of Science and Technology, Weifang, China); Liu, Zongting (School of Management, Shandong University of Technology, Zibo, China)","Liu, Zongting (Shandong University of Technology)","Gu, Jingshan (School of Economics and Management, Weifang Institute of Science and Technology, Weifang, China); Liu, Zongting (Shandong University of Technology)",0,0,,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0296890&type=printable,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1168098742,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour",11 Sustainable Cities and Communities

Workplace in a Developed Area Context,"An extremely useful theoretical approach to understanding the nature of work, health, and wellbeing is the job demand-control (JDC) model and the job demand-control-support (JDCS) model. In order for professional workers in the nongovernmental organization (NGO) sector to do their job, it is necessary for them to have a feeling of wellbeing. Despite this, in Europe, studies regarding the effects of the JDCS model in relation to workers' wellbeing have not been carried out. This study is expected to fill this important gap in research by analyzing the relationship of wellbeing with work demands, work control, and social support. In order to corroborate the proposed hypotheses, an analysis of these constructs in employees in European nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) was developed and, using structural equation models, these relationships were tested. The results confirm the main hypothesis of the job demand-control-support (JDCS) model and the causal relationship among physical and psychological demands, work control, and support from supervisors and colleagues with the level of employee wellbeing.","We thank Eurofound for providing the data set for this research.

The 7.0 magnitude earthquake in Haiti on 12 January 2010 led to more than USD 16 billion in pledges. By contrast, Hurricane Matthew, which made landfall in Haiti on 4 October 2016, stayed in the shadows, attracting about one per cent of the amount. While the earthquake exhibited one face of centralisation, the Category 4 storm laid bare rural vulnerabilities shaped by postcolonial state neglect, and reinforced by the influx of non-governmental organisations in the 'Republic of Port-au-Prince'. The study draws on data from four case studies in two departments to illuminate the legacies of hyper-centralisation in Haiti. Compounding matters, Matthew struck in the middle of an extended election that the international community attempted to control again.

The existence of the entrepreneurial phenomenon is explained from the social roots of human behaviour. Without sociability, there is no firm and without awareness, there is no responsible firm. By deeply exploring a case study of a conscious firm awarded by the Schwab Foundation for Social Entrepreneurship, this study contributes to the literature on entrepreneurship and ethical and socially responsible business management. We offer a theory and a productive model with human development that fosters entrepreneurship and makes it possible to build ethical interactions between the firm and the stakeholders. The methodology used is qualitative with a humanistic approach and presents the hypothesis that, if conscious firms want to have high productive performance, they must empower the worker in a way that turns them into entrepreneurs of their own work. The most important conclusion of this work is that conscious firms must have a productivity model that combines two processes: sustainable economic growth and comprehensive human development.

The complexity, dynamics, and multi-link features of HCRTS have made it necessary to think beyond traditional risk analysis methods. Based on the relevant literature, Functional Resonance Analysis Method (FRAM) is a relatively new systemic method for modeling and analyzing complex socio-technical systems. In this study, a methodology that integrates FRAM, fuzzy sets, and risk matrix is presented to quantitatively assess the risks factors representing failure function links in HCRTS. As the strength of function links can be illustrated by the RI (risk index) of risk factors identified in failure function links, 32 risk factors representing 12 failure function links were first identified by accident causes analysis and the framework of FRAM. Fuzzy sets were then utilized to calculate the weight of the likelihood and consequence of the risk factors. Finally, according to the assessment results of the identified risk factors by a two-dimensional risk matrix, the weaker function links in the whole HCRTS chain were identified. HCs road companies, regulatory authorities, relevant practitioners, and other stakeholders should pay more attention to these links.","The authors are grateful to MTPRC, MEMPAC, and other departments in charge of HCs for providing accident reports, as well as the introduction of HCs transportation organization process by transportation enterprises.","This research was funded by the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, grant number 3132021217; National Social Science Foundation, grant number 19BZZ104; Laboratory management research project of China Association of Higher Education, grant number 2020SYYB09; and Dalian Maritime University É??double first classÉ?ù special project (innovation project), grant number BSCXXM05.

This paper assesses motivations for the Fed liquidity lines, and the effects and spillovers of US dollar auctions by central banks using these lines. We find that the access to the Fed liquidity arrangements was driven by the recipient economies' close financial and trade ties with the US. Access to dollar liquidity also reflected global trade exposure. We find that announcements of expansion of Fed liquidity facilities or of auctions using these facilities led to appreciation of partner currencies against the US dollar and reduced these currencies' deviations from covered interest parity (CIP). Dollar auctions by major central banks (BoE, ECB, BoJ and SNB) had spillovers: they led to temporary appreciation of other currencies against the US dollar, reduced CIP deviations, and persistently reduced sovereign bond yields of other economies. However, dollar auctions done by non-major central banks with access to Fed facilities did not have a meaningful impact on key domestic financial variables. The impact of major central bank auctions does not differ by the economies' financial or trade links with the US or their balance sheet currency exposure, i.e. the major central bank auctions benefitted even the more vulnerable economies.","We would like to thank Apoorv Bhargava, Ricardo Cervantes, and Chau Nguyen for excellent research assistance.

The purpose of this paper is to discover the possible combination of conditions for enterprises to achieve high environmental performance. Based on the resource dependence theory, stakeholder theory, and externality theory, this paper constructs the theoretical framework of enterprise environmental performance evaluation and applies the fsQCA method to study the major influencing factors and mechanism of the environmental performance of listed enterprises in the Chinese mining industry. Based on the data from 2016 to 2019, the results show that there are four configurations of multiple factors leading to high environmental performance. Based on these configurations, three possible paths, internally driven, internally-externally driven, and externally driven, are established to improve environmental performance. Further, we also find that, between profitability and government regulation and between enterprise size and board independence are interchangeable condition variables; public attention outweighs other factors for Chinese mining enterprises. Countermeasures and suggestions from perspectives of government supervision, public concern, and enterprise internal governance are proposed at the end the study.",,This research was funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (41701617).,International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,Paul B.

However, the usefulness of these strategies is sometimes limited in the face of the complexity and uncertainty that characterize these processes over time and the situation at both patient and institutional levels. We found this to be the case when we did an in-depth qualitative study of coordination processes in patient pathways for three diagnoses in four Norwegian hospitals. What allows these hospitals to accomplish coordination is supplementing standardization with improvisation. This improvisation is embedded in four types of emerging semi-formal structures: collegial communities, networks, boundary spanners, and physical proximity. The hierarchical higher administrative levels appear to have a limited ability to manage and support coordination of these emerging structures when needed. We claim that this can be explained by viewing line management as representative of an economic-administrative institutional logic while these emerging structures represent a medical-professional logic that privileges proximity to the variation and complexity in the situations. The challenge is then to find a way for emergent and formal structures to coexist.",The authors like to thank associate Bj??rn Erik M??rk and associate Trond Tjerbo for useful comments connected to the performance of the project and the development of the manuscript.

Despite the developing international interest in multihazard events, few studies quantify the dynamic interactions that characterize these phenomena. It is argued that without considering the dynamic complexity of natural catastrophes, impact assessments will underestimate risk and misinform emergency management priorities. The ability to generate multihazard scenarios with impacts at a desired level is important for emergency planning and resilience assessment. This article demonstrates a framework for using graph theory and networks to generate and model the complex impacts of multihazard scenarios. First, the combination of maximal hazard footprints and exposed nodes (e.g.,?ˇinfrastructure) is used to create the hazard network. Iterative simulation of the network, defined by actual hazard magnitudes, is then used to provide the overall compounded impact from a sequence of hazards. Outputs of the method are used to study distributional ranges of multihazards impact. The 2016 Kaikèçura earthquake is used as a calibrating event to demonstrate that the method can reproduce the same scale of impacts as a real event. The cascading hazards included numerous landslides, allowing us to show that the scenario set generated includes the actual impacts that occurred during the 2016 events.","This work was supported by the Resilience to Nature&#x27;s Challenges (RNC).

Accordingly, many aviation stakeholders put hopes into the ongoing process of vaccination, with the expectation that a high degree of vaccination will push the envelope for a return to normalcy. One prerequisite for reviving international air connectivity is the introduction of verification documents, also called ""vaccination passports"". These passports, however, come with several challenges which need to be overcome in order to enable recovery. In this study, we propose a framework covering five important aspects and policy challenges concerning the introduction of vaccination passports for a return of aviation, covering the topics: Competition, Epidemiology, Technology, Ethics, and Politics. Neglecting to appropriately address these challenges will likely not only delay the recovery, but possibly miss an important opportunity before new disastrous events appear on the horizon.","This study is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 61861136005, No. 61650110516, and No. 71731001).",,Transport Policy,,,,44376,2021,44376,2021-09,110,,394-401,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Sun, Xiaoqian; Wandelt, Sebastian; Zhang, Anming","Sun, Xiaoqian (National Key Laboratory of CNS/ATM, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, 100191, Beijing, China.; National Engineering Laboratory of Multi-Modal Transportation Big Data, 100191, Beijing, China.); Wandelt, Sebastian (National Key Laboratory of CNS/ATM, School of Electronic and Information Engineering, Beihang University, 100191, Beijing, China.; National Engineering Laboratory of Multi-Modal Transportation Big Data, 100191, Beijing, China.); Zhang, Anming (Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada.)","Wandelt, Sebastian (Beihang University; National Engineering Laboratory of Multi-Modal Transportation Big Data, 100191, Beijing, China.)","Sun, Xiaoqian (Beihang University; National Engineering Laboratory of Multi-Modal Transportation Big Data, 100191, Beijing, China.); Wandelt, Sebastian (Beihang University; National Engineering Laboratory of Multi-Modal Transportation Big Data, 100191, Beijing, China.); Zhang, Anming (University of British Columbia)",35,32,0.98,16.28,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tranpol.2021.06.018,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139246392,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",

More recently, bidirectional deep learning models (BiLSTM) have extended the LSTM capabilities by training the input data twice in forward and backward directions. In this paper, BiLSTM short term traffic forecasting models have been developed and evaluated using data from a calibrated micro-simulation model for a congested freeway in Melbourne, Australia. The simulation model was extensively calibrated and validated to a high degree of accuracy using field data collected from 55 detectors on the freeway. The base year simulation model was then used to generate loop detector data including speed, flow and occupancy which were used to develop and compare a number of LSTM models for short-term traffic prediction up to 60?ˇmin into the future. The modelling results showed that BiLSTM outperformed other predictive models for multiple prediction horizons for base year conditions. The simulation model was then adapted for future year scenarios where the traffic demand was increased by 25É??100 percent to reflect potential future increases in traffic demands. The results showed superior performance of BiLSTM for multiple prediction horizons for all traffic variables.","The first author would like to acknowledge her Ph.D. scholarship provided by the Iraqi Government and Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne, Australia.",,Scientific Reports,,,,44543,2021,44543,,11,1,23899,All OA; Gold,Article,"Abduljabbar, Rusul L.; Dia, Hussein; Tsai, Pei-Wei","Abduljabbar, Rusul L.

We then distinguish, for example, exploration-based acquisitions, conducted after a series of exploitation-based acquisitions. Our results suggest that the market takes a portfolio perspective when reacting to an acquisition. In support of the ambidexterity literature, we show that the market responds positively to a switch from one type of strategy to another. Zooming in on the direction of the shift, we find that the market responds more positively to a switch towards exploration after exploitation, compared with the alternative. In so doing, we contribute to the literature on acquisition motives, by showing that prior announcements matter in explaining market reactions, and we contribute to the literature on ambidexterity, by showing that the market favours firms that oscillate between exploration and exploitation.","As part of the FINDER program this project has received funding from the European UnionÉ??s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under the Marie Skè?odowska-Curie grant agreement No 813095.

Although there is growing evidence of applications of AI in workplaces across all industries to simplify and/or automate tasks there is a limited understanding of the role that AI contributes in addressing occupational safety and health (OSH) concerns.
METHODS: This paper introduces a new framework called Risk Evolution, Detection, Evaluation, and Control of Accidents (REDECA) that highlights the role that AI plays in the anticipation and control of exposure risks in a worker's immediate environment. Two hundred and sixty AI papers across five sectors (oil and gas, mining, transportation, construction, and agriculture) were reviewed using the REDECA framework to highlight current applications and gaps in OSH and AI fields.
RESULTS: The REDECA framework highlighted the unique attributes and research focus of each of the five industrial sectors. The majority of evidence of AI in OSH research within the oil/gas and transportation sectors focused on the development of sensors to detect hazardous situations. In construction the focus was on the use of sensors to detect incidents. The research in the agriculture sector focused on sensors and actuators that removed workers from hazardous conditions. Application of the REDECA framework highlighted AI/OSH strengths and opportunities in various industries and potential areas for collaboration.
CONCLUSIONS: As AI applications across industries continue to increase, further exploration of the benefits and challenges of AI applications in OSH is needed to optimally protect worker health, safety and well-being.",Its contents are solely the responsibility of the authors and do not necessarily represent the official views of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the Department of Health and Human Services.,"This research is partially supported by the grant T42OH008672, funded by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.",International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,,"Sara L.

We first review perspectives that offer competing evidence about the role of globalization in regard to economic development and corruption. Drawing on resource dependence and institutional theory, we test the two contingencies of the countryÉ??s stage of economic development (low, lower-middle, upper-middle, high) and the globalization dimension (economic, social, political) at play to reconcile competing findings. Using a cross-lagged panel design, we show that these contingencies significantly explain when and what type of globalization can benefit a countryÉ??s economy and affect corruption. In doing so, the study provides a platform for future research, and identifies important patterns that can better guide policymaking. Among other results, we find low-income countriesÉ?? GDP and corruption benefit the most from the formal dimensions of globalization. With increased wealth, countries are more responsive to the legitimacy accrued with the informal dimensions of globalization, which we find comes at the expense of economic efficiency for high-income countries.","We would like to acknowledge the extremely helpful guidance from our editor, Axele Giroud, and the three anonymous reviewers.

Cyber physical systems offer the required preconditions for supply chain preparation and management flexibility. But for companies, it is a big challenge to build such a scheme. Strategic and contemporary problems are the maintenance of supply chains and their subsystems. Supply chainsÉ?? profitability relies on their rapid versatility. Logistics must prepare for the versatility needs as a supply chain mechanism using an increased concentration of knowledge and advanced data collection and analytics technologies. Indeed, the knowledge flow which controls the physical flow represents a critical problem for supply chain management. While the overarching goals of Supply Chain 4.0 are to improve distributing procedures using the production process and use of broad perspective, flexibility, and new technologies, with the overall objective of increasing productivity, promptness, and competitiveness. Chain 4.0, in operating its manufacturing and information technology systems, lacks semantic requirements, weak compatibility, and a lack of protection. Blockchain, intelligent contracts, implementations of artificial intelligence, cyber-physical networks, the Internet of Things, and digital industrial economy form the foundation technology of the Supply Chain 4.0. Each technology creates cyber security problems, separately and in combination, which must be solved. The research uses interfaces to other similar applications in business-level topics (e.g., supply chains). The vision may contribute to discovering new guidelines for structural control, such as Industry 4.0. Technology-enabled new manufacturing strategy that requires highly customized network supply control, resilient regulatory compliance, management decision-making improvement for the design and planning, and monitoring of robust and digital manufacturers are a few examples of how manufacturing and logistics networks endorse operator 4.0 change are the cobots, enhanced reality, and inventive workstations. Another theme in this field is sustainable production processes and other closed-loop supply chains. Increased elements and structures include considering diverse and heterogeneous business systems (e.g., decision-making). These are interdependent networks and are developed by various stakeholders. To take advantage of this, a system-of-systems ecosystem is required to integrate systems (SoS). Models are needed that evolve to the globalized society. Some of the adaptation is through listening; others have intelligent agentsÉ?? self-organization. In general, model and device adjustment and (self-)adaptation must be scalable and supported. Loose coupling and developing system infrastructure are required. For the coming years, the vision of the analysis communityÉ??s overall contribution in transport and industrial processes will be to put researchers together to present and address topics related to new manufacturing modeling management and control in the evolving industry of resilient and creative SoS and supply networks focused on Industry 4.0. Industry 4.0 provides tremendous opportunities for businesses and suppliers through increasingly digitalizing supply chain operations. Cyber physical systems offer the required preconditions for supply chain preparation and management flexibility. Individually tailored commodity requirements contribute to the difficulty of supply chain preparation and management (SCs). Digitizing business processes is a crucial development and a necessary prerequisite to achieving optimum flexibility and performance. Modern electronic communication systems are used for the present synchronization of networked SCs. The hypernym É??Industry 4.0É?ù sums up this digitalization of the industry in Germany. Even though the term É??Industry 4.0É?ù has been in existence for many years, no uniform definition exists.

Potential attack vectors are identified and analyzed for the attacks attributed to the unauthorized impact on open-source libraries/components used to develop the software. Limitations are identified in the models of threats associated with software supply chain attacks. Measures required for protection against threats associated with attacks on software supply chains are identified and classified based on the analysis of available regulatory documents and guidelines pertaining to the supply chain security, and best practices of secure software development. Classification of protective measures is provided for threats associated with an unauthorized impact on the open-source libraries/components used to develop software. Classification criteria were suggested, namely, security mechanisms, information protection methods, software development life cycle (according to ISO/IEC 12207). The conclusion has been drawn on the need to develop international legislative regulations and legal norms pertaining to the information security of software supply chains, and possible areas of improvement were described #COMESYSO1120.",,,Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing,Software Engineering Perspectives in Intelligent Systems,"Radek Silhavy, Petr Silhavy, Zdenka Prokopova",,44181,2020,44181,2020,1294,,115-129,Closed,Chapter,"Barabanov, Alexander; Markov, Alexey; Tsirlov, Valentin","Barabanov, Alexander (Bauman Moscow State Technical University, 105005, Moscow, Russia); Markov, Alexey (Bauman Moscow State Technical University, 105005, Moscow, Russia); Tsirlov, Valentin (NPO Echelon, JSC, 107023, Moscow, Russia)","Markov, Alexey (Bauman Moscow State Technical University)","Barabanov, Alexander (Bauman Moscow State Technical University); Markov, Alexey (Bauman Moscow State Technical University); Tsirlov, Valentin (NPO Echelon, JSC, 107023, Moscow, Russia)",5,4,,1.96,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133533618,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4604 Cybersecurity and Privacy; 4609 Information Systems; 4612 Software Engineering",

This paper aims to investigate the ways in which the accelerating demand for increased security of supply of equipment and supplies to the Armed Forces requires adaptability in the procurement process that is governed by laws on public procurement (PP).   Design/methodology/approach This paper is based on a review of current literature as well as empirical data obtained through interviews with representatives from the Swedish Defence Materiel Administration and the Swedish defence industry.   Findings Collaboration with the globalized defence industry requires new approaches, where the PP rules make procurement of a safe supply of defence equipment difficult.   Research limitations/implications The study's empirical data and findings are based on the Swedish context. In order to draw more general conclusions in a defence context, the study should be expanded to cover more nations.   Practical implications The findings will enable the defence industry and the procurement authorizations to better understand the requirements of Armed Forces, and how to cooperate under applicable legal and regulatory requirements.   Originality/value The paper extends the extant body of academic knowledge of the security of supply into the defence sector. It serves as a first step towards articulating a call for new approaches to collaboration in defence supply chains.","Acknowledgement is extended to Thomas Ekstr??m of the Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI), Department of Defence Economy and Defence Logistics Division.

                    Defence supply chains (SCs) aim at operational outcomes, and armed forces depend on them to provide availability and preparedness in peace and sustainability in war. Previous research has focussed on strategies for SCs aiming at financial outcomes. This raises the question of how suitable commercial supply chain strategies (SCSs) are for supply chain design (SCD) in defence. The purpose of this paper is to explain the constructs of SCSs that satisfy military operational requirements and to propose SCSs that are appropriate in defence.
                  
                  
                    Design/methodology/approach
                    This paper reports on a Delphi study with 20 experts from Swedish defence authorities. Through three Delphi rounds, two workshops and a validation round, these experts contributed to the reported findings.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The findings demonstrate that commercial SC constructs are acceptable and applicable in defence but not sufficient. An additional strategy is required to satisfy requirements on availability, preparedness and sustainability. The paper shows that different requirements in peace and war make it challenging to design suitable defence SCs and proposes eight SCSs that satisfy these requirements.
                  
                  
                    Research limitations/implications
                    The results emanate from the Swedish defence context and further research is required for generalisation.

Macro-trends and sectoral-specific evolutions are changing the way companies produce, distribute and build relationships in their supply network and with customers. Aiming to investigate the effective implementation of new supply chain concepts and innovation needs identified in the previous sections, this chapter provides a study of multiple cases of excellence among European supply chains. It depicts an overview of major trends and structural features of 8 key industries for European economy, i.e. Automotive, Aerospace, Fashion, Chemical, IT, Distribution/logistics, Furniture, Food and Beverage. For each industry, a structured investigation into one or more companies was performed with a total of 18 companies involved. The results identify possible matchings in relation to supply chain strategies, and good and best practices adopted accordingly.","We are grateful to all contributors of the Next-Net project team and particularly to Ana Cristina Barros, Pedro Senna, Riccardo Zimmermann Victoria Muerza, Eva Thanous, Cemre Multu, Sebastien Balech, Saskia Sardesai.

This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the development of the statements over time for two large companies in different sectors and with contrasting characteristics. We show that the statements progress in sophistication over time, but have serious limitations. We demonstrate that although they present interesting information about the management of working conditions in the firmsÉ?? supply chains, they do little to address the problems of modern slavery per se. Furthermore, we show that the statements can contrast strongly with other documents published by the firm, and with established patterns of business practice. For both firms, we show that a deep understanding of the context of the organization is essential for interpreting the statements É?? but this contextual information is unlikely to be available to the casual reader.

An empirically grounded framework operationalizes the concept of socialÉ??ecological resilience by expounding resilience capabilities across phases of the CAS adaptive cycle.   Design/methodology/approach This research uses a qualitative multiple case study approach. It draws on the case of the Australian Defence Manufacturing SN (ADM SN) during COVID-19 disruptions. A total of 28 interviews with senior decision makers from 17 companies, complemented by 5 interviews with the Australian Defence SC organizations and secondary data analysis, support the findings.   Findings Individual organizationsÉ?? SC visibility and flexibility enabled by effective risk management and collaboration enhance the ability of the SN to anticipate and prepare for disruption. At the same time, the strength of SC relationships reduces resilience. SN disruption response velocity is enabled by inventory redundancy, process flexibility at the organizational level and visibility and collaboration at the SC level. Institutional support at the national industry level, development of value-adding capabilities and manufacturing process flexibility at the organizational level enhances the SNÉ??s ability to re-organize. The transition from hierarchical to decentralized collaborative governance enhances SN resilience.   Practical implications From a practitionerÉ??s perspective, the findings highlight the need to embrace a broader view of SC beyond immediate tiers. Decision-makers in multinational companies must recognize the long-term impact of their procurement decisions on the supplier ecosystem. Developing local supplier capabilities rather than relying on established global SCs will pay off with future resilience. It, however, demands substantial investment and radical changes across all SC tiers. The lesson for smaller firms is not to over-rely on the existing relationships with supply partners. Although trust-based relationships and collaboration are essential, over-commitment can be counterproductive during global disruptions. With a lack of visibility and control over the SC, operational flexibility is critical for small firms to adapt to shifts in supply and demand.   Originality/value To the best of the authorsÉ?? knowledge, this empirical research is one of the first attempts to operationalize the socialÉ??ecological perspective of SN resilience. Evidence-based theoretical propositions contribute to the emerging conversation about the CAS nature of resilience by demonstrating the multi-level effects of resilience capabilities.","Some of the findings reported in this paper are based on the data from a previous study funded by Defence SA, and the authors would like to acknowledge the contribution from A/Prof Shruti Sardeshmukh, Mr Matt Opie and Mr David Eyre.",,Supply Chain Management An International Journal,,,,45146,2023,45146,45293,29,1,45317,Closed,Article,"Statsenko, Larissa; Jayasinghe, Ruchini Senarath; Soosay, Claudine","Statsenko, Larissa (UniSA STEM, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia); Jayasinghe, Ruchini Senarath (UniSA Online, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia); Soosay, Claudine (UniSA Business, University of South Australia, Adelaide, Australia)","Statsenko, Larissa (University of South Australia)","Statsenko, Larissa (University of South Australia); Jayasinghe, Ruchini Senarath (University of South Australia); Soosay, Claudine (University of South Australia)",3,3,,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163026163,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",

                    A novel integrated case study and Straussian grounded theory approach under the interpretative assumptions and purposive sampling in a global defence industry organisation are presented.
                  
                  
                    Findings
                    The TT is approached from the process modelling point of view, and a detailed operations description covering the end-to-end TT process across a defence industrial participation project is presented. The findings suggest that local recipientÉ??s management, financial resources and planning, supply chain management and local production planning are the main factors of an efficient process.

There are many maturity models available but many of them have not been validated or do not provide a useful guide or tool for applications. This gap creates the need for a review of the existing maturity model's applicability.   Design/methodology/approach Nineteen peer-reviewed maturity models related to É??Digital Transformation,É?ù É??Industry 4.0É?ù or É??Smart ManufacturingÉ?ù were selected based on a systematic literature review and five consulting firm models were selected based on the author's industry knowledge. The chosen models were analyzed to determine 10 categories of dimensions. Then they are assessed on a 1É??5 scale for how applicable they are in the 10 categories of dimensions.   Findings The five É??consulting firmÉ?ù models have a first-mover advantage, are more widely used in industry and are more applicable, but some require payment, and they lack published details and validation. The 19 É??peer reviewedÉ?ù models are not as widely used, lack awareness in the industry and are not as easy to apply because of no web tool for self-assessment, but they are improving. The categories defined to characterize the models and facilitate comparisons for users include É??Information Technology (IT) and Cyber-Physical System (CPS) and Data,É?ù É??Strategy and Organization,É?ù É??Supply Chain and Logistics,É?ù É??Products and Services,É?ù É??Culture and Employees,É?ù É??Technology and Capabilities,É?ù É??Customer and Market,É?ù É??Cybersecurity and Risk,É?ù É??Leadership and ManagementÉ?ù and É??Governance and Compliance.É?ù The analyzed maturity models were particularly weak in the areas of cybersecurity, leadership and governance.

Especially in the last few years, sustainability has been among the issues that attracts the attention of the countries, companies and academics. Sustainability is the effective use of resources to meet the present needs of the world in order to avoid problems in meeting the needs of future generations. One of the crucial component of the sustainability in companies is supply chain management. When the 3 dimensions of sustainability (environmental, social and economic) have been taken into consideration in supply chain management, the concept of sustainable supply chain management has emerged. Sustainable Supply Chain Management is the management of flow of information, material and capital along the supply chain among the firms, by taking economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development into account which stem for the expectations of customers and stakeholders. In recent years, companies started to adopt the sustainability principles due to legal obligations, public awareness and activities of non-governmental organizations. Applications within the companies regarding sustainability principles are discussed in detail in their sustainability reports. In the previous studies, researchers have examined the sustainability reports regarding economics concerns or whether they comply with the pre-determined criteria. However, there has been no study about companiesÉ?? actions in supply chain management by examining sustainability reports. Therefore, in this study, sustainability reports of the companies which are in BIST (Borsa Istanbul Stock Exchange) Sustainability Index in Turkey were examined and by looking at these reports, their actions about sustainable supply chain management were discussed in detail. In this study, the practices of companies to establish a sustainable supply chain were discussed. In the last part of the study, suggestions were made to guide the companies which will implement sustainable supply chain management.",,,Lecture Notes on Data Engineering and Communications Technologies,Proceedings of the Sixteenth International Conference on Management Science and Engineering Management É??

System sustainment is a multitrillion-dollar enterprise, in government (infrastructure and defense) and industry (transportation, industrial controls, data centers, and others). Systems associated with human safety, the delivery of critical services, important humanitarian, and military missions and global economic stability are often compromised by the failure to develop, resource, and implement effective long-term sustainment strategies. System sustainment is, unfortunately, an area that has traditionally been dominated by transactional processes with little strategic planning, policy, or methodological support.

Supply Chain (SASC) currently exhibits significant cybersecurity gaps. It is
well-established that data obtained from space assets is fundamental to NATO,
as they allow for the facilitation of its missions, self-defence and effective
deterrence of its adversaries. Any hostile cyber operation, suspending control
over a space asset, severely impacts both NATO missions and allied Member
States national security. This threat is exacerbated by NATOs mostly
unregulated cyber SASC. Hence, this thesis answers a twofold research question:
a) What are current cybersecurity gaps along NATOs global SASC; and b) How can
NATO and its allied Member States gain greater control over such gaps to
safeguard the supply of NATO mission-critical information? An ontological field
study is carried out by conducting nineteen semi-structured interviews with
high-level representatives from relevant public, private and academic
organizations. This research was undertaken in collaboration with the NATO
Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) in Tallinn, Estonia.
This thesis concludes that current cybersecurity gaps along NATOs SASC are
caused by cyber vulnerabilities such as legacy systems or the use of
Commercial-Off-the-Shelf (COTS) technology. Inadequate cyber SASC management is
caused by hindrances such as misaligned classification levels and significant
understaffing. On this basis, NATO should consider two major collaboration
initiatives: a) Raising Awareness throughout the whole of the NATO system, and
b) Pushing forward the creation of regulation through a standardized security
framework on SASC cybersecurity. Doing so would enable NATO and its Member
States to recognise cyberthreats to mission-critical data early on along its
cyber SASC, and thus increase transparency, responsibility, and liability.",,,arXiv,,,,44245,2021,,,,,,All OA; Green,Preprint,"Vollmer, Berenike","Vollmer, Berenike ()",,"Vollmer, Berenike ()",0,0,,0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135557054,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems",

Hospitals are a key link in the supply chain, where they are the end customer, the supply chain from the manufacturer through all bottlenecks. A complete description of the distribution of medical supplies can be summarized into an external and internal supply chain. The external circuit represents the supply of the necessary commodities and ends at the distribution point. The internal circuit continues to the nursing units of the hospital supply chain. Currently, two basic forms are used for the distribution of supplies to the level of nursing units, through the regions, or through the supply from the humanitarian warehouse. The acquisition, storage, and distribution processes depend on the material availability on the market and the level of the maintained stocks.

In the defence sector, PBL entails outsourcing weapon system-related maintenance and logistics activities in such a way that it incentivises suppliers to invest in equipment reliability and process improvements at a reasonable cost. Research has advanced our knowledge of how PBL contracts are designed and implemented, but we still have only limited understanding of PBL evaluation issues, specifically PBL effectiveness and its influencing factors. Focusing on the defence context, we address this knowledge gap through a systematic literature review and synthesis of 45 peer-reviewed articles. We identify 15 factors influencing PBL effectiveness, which are grouped into six categories: governance, supply chain management, defence buyer input, innovation, environmental factors, and resources and capabilities. We extend prior research by developing a classification framework of the factors influencing PBL effectiveness. Further, we leverage defence industry-specific characteristics to suggest avenues for impactful future research through a series of propositions, including the need to examine how political factors influence the effectiveness of performance-based contracting in the defence sector. We also suggest that environmental sustainability and resilience requirements should be included when evaluating the effectiveness of PBL contracts and defence contracting more generally.","Declaration of competing interest The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper Acknowledgments and Funding This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial or not-for-profit sectors.",,Journal of Purchasing and Supply Management,,,,2023-12,2023,,2023-12,29,5,100877,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Alqahtani, Faris; Selviaridis, Kostas; Stevenson, Mark","Alqahtani, Faris (Lancaster University Management School, Lancaster, LA1 4YX, United Kingdom); Selviaridis, Kostas (Lancaster University Management School, Lancaster, LA1 4YX, United Kingdom); Stevenson, Mark (Lancaster University Management School, Lancaster, LA1 4YX, United Kingdom)","Alqahtani, Faris (Lancaster University)","Alqahtani, Faris (Lancaster University); Selviaridis, Kostas (Lancaster University); Stevenson, Mark (Lancaster University)",1,1,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pursup.2023.100877,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1163977695,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3507 Strategy, Management and Organisational Behaviour; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains",

Supply chains relate to the network of entities that are interdependent and that directly or indirectly serve the final consumer. Although the utilization of supply chains have been shown to increase efficiency and assist in cutting costs in the commercial sector, the complexity of logistics in the military environment cannot always be paralleled to those of the business environment. Furthermore, in the military, similarly to in the hospital environment, medical supplies must be available, whenever they are needed, to prevent the endangering of lives. While several studies have examined the outcomes of the management of medical supplies in hospitals and healthcare organizations worldwide, limited research has been published that addresses the management of medical supplies in the unique medical environment within the military. Alongside an outline of the challenges faced in managing medical supplies, the article presents some of the systems used for supply chain management in the military across the globe.

Second, it offers a look at the Chinese GovernmentÉ??s approach to fighting cyberattacks on Chinese SCs and its calls for global governance.   Design/methodology/approach A comprehensive literature review was conducted on Clarivate AnalyticsÉ?? Web of Science, in Social Sciences Citation Index journals, Scopus and Google Scholar, published between 2010É??2021. A systematic review of practitioner literature was also conducted.   Findings Chinese SCs have become a matter of national security, especially in the era of cyber warfare. The risks to SC have been outlined. Cybersecurity regulations are increasing as China aims to build a robust environment for cyberspace development. Using the Technology-organization-environment (TOE) framework, the results show that the top five factors influencing the adoption process in firms are as follows: relative advantage and technological readiness (Technology context); top management support and firm size (Organization context) and government policy and regulations (Environment context).   Research limitations/implications This review focuses on cyberattacks on Chinese SCs and great care was taken when selecting search terms. However, the author acknowledges that the choice of databases/terms may have excluded a few articles on cyberattacks from this review.   Practical implications This review provides managerial insights for SC practitioners into how cyberattacks have the potential to disrupt the global SC network.

Design/methodology/approach By conducting semi-structured interviews of practitioners with deep knowledge of AM and supply chains from diverse industries, this research explores the contingent factors influencing AM adoption and their interaction.   Findings While the AM literature is growing, there is a lack of research investigating how contingent factors influence AM adoption. By reviewing the extant literature on the benefits and barriers of AM, we explain the underlying contingencies that enact them. Further, we use an exploratory approach to validate and uncover underexplored contingent factors that influence AM adoption and group them into technological, organizational and strategic factors. By anchoring to a selected set of contingent factors, a typological framework is developed to explain when and how AM is a viable option.   Research limitations/implications This study focuses on specific industries such as automotive, machine manufacturing, aerospace and defense. Scholars are encouraged to explore the contextual factors affecting AM adoption in particular industries to expand our findings. The authors also acknowledge that the robustness of their framework can be enhanced by integrating the remaining contingent factors.   Practical implications The developed typological framework provides a pathway for practitioners to see how and when AM can be useful in their supply chains.   Originality/value This is the first paper in the supply chain management literature to synthesize contingent factors and identify some overlooked factors for AM adoption. The research is also unique in explaining the interaction among selected factors to provide a typological framework for AM adoption. This research provides novel insights for managers to understand when and where to adopt AM and the key contingent factors involved in AM adoption.","We acknowledge the infrastructure and support of Center for Agile and Adaptive Additive Manufacturing (CAAAM) funded through State of Texas Appropriation #190405-105-805008-220 at the University of North Texas, Denton.",,International Journal of Operations & Production Management,,,,44894,2022,44894,44991,43,3,489-519,Closed,Article,"Patil, Himali; Niranjan, Suman; Narayanamurthy, Gopalakrishnan; Narayanan, Arunachalam","Patil, Himali (Department of Logistics and Operations Management, University of North Texas, Denton, Texas, USA); Niranjan, Suman (Department of Logistics and Operations Management, University of North Texas, Denton, Texas, USA); Narayanamurthy, Gopalakrishnan (Department of Operations and Supply Chain Management, Management School, University of Liverpool, Liverpool, UK); Narayanan, Arunachalam (Department of Information Technology and Decision Sciences, University of North Texas, Denton, Texas, USA)","Narayanan, Arunachalam (University of North Texas)","Patil, Himali (University of North Texas); Niranjan, Suman (University of North Texas); Narayanamurthy, Gopalakrishnan (University of Liverpool); Narayanan, Arunachalam (University of North Texas)",2,2,,1.75,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1153148018,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3503 Business Systems In Context",

The global economy has widened and deepened the supply chain, resulting in larger numbers of geographically dispersed locations and increased difficulty ensuring the authenticity and security of critical digital assets. Although the nuclear industry has made significant strides in securing facilities from cyber-attacks, the supply chain remains vulnerable. This paper discusses supply chain threats and vulnerabilities that are often overlooked in nuclear cyber supply chain risk analysis. A novel supply chain cyber-attack surface diagram is provided to assist with enumeration of risks and to examine the complex issues surrounding the requirements for securing hardware, firmware, software, and system information throughout the entire supply chain lifecycle.

Challenges to the Monetary Policy Landscape from a Changing Geopolitical Environment,"Over the past decade, geopolitical developments - and the policy responses to these by major economies around the world - have challenged economic openness and the process of globalisation, with implications for the economic environment in which central banks operate. The return of war to Europe and the energy shock triggered by the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 are the latest in a series of episodes that have led the European Union (EU) to develop its Open Strategic Autonomy (OSA) agenda. This Report is a broad attempt to take stock of these developments from a central banking perspective. It analyses the EU's economic interdependencies and their implications for trade and finance, with a focus on strategically important dimensions such as energy, critical raw materials, food, foreign direct investment and financial market infrastructures. Against this background, the Report discusses relevant aspects of the EU's OSA policy agenda which extend to trade, industrial and state aid measures, as well as EU initiatives to strengthen and protect the internal market and further develop Economic and Monetary Union (EMU).

Disruptions affected all food supply chains, including those critical to national security. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to reveal the impact of the pandemic on the military food supply chain in Poland. In the analysed single case study, we used process mapping to show the diversity of the types of military food supply chains operating in military units. The attention was focused on the internal and external food supply chains in the context of the disruptions and dysfunctions that appeared in the sphere of management. The contribution of the article is twofold. First, we used a situational crisis management approach to isolate four types of internal military food supply chains.

Indeed, cost escalation represents a challenge but, in fact, these reforms try to adjust the functioning of defence market rather than questioning the institutional features of this latter. The success of defence acquisition structures also explains their limits. The current organisation of defence market was perfectly adapted to the geostrategic context of Cold War and a technological momentum that favours symmetrical arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. Even if these structures still help deliver advanced capabilities, they can be considered as not sufficient to cover all the operational needs of armed forces. The conception of capabilities needs to go beyond a long-term planning while industrial approaches open the way to more agile development and manufacturing. An alternative defence industrial policy is necessary to complement the existing one. More modular architectures for complex systems provide the opportunity to increase the reactiveness of capability deliveries and to foster both innovation and competition.","The author is grateful to anonymous reviewers, who provided very relevant comments that helped significantly improve this article.

A multi-actor perspective of performance based contracts,"Performance based contract (PBC) is an innovative advanced service strategy for offering product service solutions. PBC aims at increasing customer value and reducing the costs of operations. However, manufacturers incur unquantifiable É??hidden costsÉ?ù while implementing PBC. This paper uses agency theory and service-dominant logic to build a theoretical framework to study the hidden costs of PBCs. The research uses a multiple exploratory case study approach to unravel the drivers of hidden costs during the design, delivery and adaptation phases of PBC. This paper derives findings from five PBCs from the UK defence industry. The analysis reveals four major hidden cost drivers (supplier relations, contract complexity, customer relations, and cost estimation problems) of PBC. The research refines the theoretical framework by linking the hidden cost drivers, PBC life cycle stages and engagement of the service network partners. It develops a set of propositions for guiding future research and managerial practices.","Acknowledgements The author is grateful to the Editor, Special Issue Editors and two anonymous reviewers for their constructive feedback that helped improve the manuscript.

Lack of engagement in cybersecurity policies and process implementation by the tier companies providing hardware or services to OEMs within this ecosystem poses a significant risk to not only the individual companies but to the ecosystem overall. The proposed quantitative method of estimating cybersecurity risk allows vendors to have visibility to the financial risk associated with potential threats and to consequently allocate adequate resources to cybersecurity. It facilitates faster implementation of defense measures and provides a useful tool in the vendor selection process. The paper focuses on cybersecurity risk assessment as a critical part of the overall company mission to create a sustainable structure for maintaining cybersecurity health. Compound cybersecurity risk and impact on company operations as outputs of this quantitative analysis present a unique opportunity to strategically plan and make informed decisions towards acquiring a reputable position in a sustainable ecosystem. This method provides attack trees and assigns a risk factor to each vendor thus offering a competitive advantage and an insight into the supply chain risk map. This is an innovative way to look at vendor cybersecurity posture. Through a selection of unique industry specific parameters and a modular approach, this risk assessment model can be employed as a tool to navigate the supply base and prevent significant financial cost. It generates synergies within the connected vehicle ecosystem leading to a safe and sustainable economy.",,,,2022 10th International Scientific Conference on Computer Science (COMSCI),,,44714,2022,,44714,0,,45298,Closed,Proceeding,"Tzoneva, Albena; Momcheva, Galina; Stoyanov, Borislav","Tzoneva, Albena (Department Computer Science, Varna Free University É??Chernorizets HrabarÉ?ù, Varna, Bulgaria); Momcheva, Galina (Department Computer Science, Varna Free University É??Chernorizets HrabarÉ?ù, Varna, Bulgaria); Stoyanov, Borislav (Department Computer Science, Varna Free University É??Chernorizets HrabarÉ?ù, Varna, Bulgaria)","Tzoneva, Albena (Varna Free University)","Tzoneva, Albena (Varna Free University); Momcheva, Galina (Varna Free University); Stoyanov, Borislav (Varna Free University)",0,0,,0,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151795006,"35 Commerce, Management, Tourism and Services; 3509 Transportation, Logistics and Supply Chains; 46 Information and Computing Sciences; 4609 Information Systems",

It even starts to affect sectors that were not considered to be at risk in the past because of their relative isolation. One of these sectors is aviation in general, and specifically air traffic management (ATM). New developments in technology and the---ever increasing---trend to interconnect systems have drastically changed this landscape. Like many safety relevant sectors, the general attitude in aviation is rather conservative. Safety practitioners prefer slow changes, which conflicts with the ""rapid response"" requirements coming from the (cyber)security area. Air traffic management systems are large socio-technical systems, a fact that adds an additional dimension to the cybersecurity complexity. In this paper I will address a subset of sector specific challenges that we have to address in the ATM domain. The number of challenges is quite substantial and topics like security policies, risk assessment methodologies and vulnerabilities in specific areas (e.g. ADS-B) can be found in the literature.

This interest lies primarily in understanding the trends, benefits, and implications of AM technology on supply chain (SC) and logistics, as it requires reconfiguring the supply chain based on a distributed manufacturing strategy, closer to the consumer market, with shorter lead times and less raw materials. It still is an emerging field, and needs further study. Therefore, a better understanding of main trends will contribute to the dissemination of knowledge about AM technology and its consolidation. This article seeks to investigate the implications of AM, as an advanced manufacturing model, on SC and logistics. A four-step research method was used to develop a systematic literature review and a bibliometric analysis on the AM implications in SC and logistics. The main implications of AM on SC and logistics were classified in seven key issues gathered as result of the literature review. Additionally, bibliometric study allowed understanding researches major trends in this field. The key aspects highlighted and characterized as major implications of AM on SC and logistic are: supply chain complexity reduction; more flexible logistics and inventory management; better spreading and popularization of mass customization; decentralization of manufacturing; greater design freedom and rapid prototyping; increasing of resource efficiency and sustainability, and the need to have clearly defined legal and safety aspects.",,,Independent Journal of Management & Production,,,,44044,2020,44044,,11,4,1279-1302,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vel?≠zquez, Daniel R.
